He has evaded justice time and time again as he ransacked numerous Dominion holdings.  Arcturus Mengsk has begun seeking Schezar out to make an example out of him to other dissidents of his Dominion role.
Button/Tooltip/Aldaris=<c val="ffff8a">A preeminent Judicator, Aldaris liaises between the Conclave and the leaders of the Templar Caste. </c><n/><n/>Aldaris is a strong believer in the Protoss vision of the New Beginning. He holds the virtues of communal achievement and selfless honour above all things. Charged with watching over Tassadar’s command of the expeditionary force, Aldaris was quick to chastise the younger Protoss for his mistakes. Aldaris has no compunction against branding those who do not conform to Protoss dogma as heretics and traitors.
Button/Tooltip/Aleksander=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The mighty flagship of the UED Expeditionary Force.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Laser Batteries<n/>Yamato Cannon</c><n/><n/>The DSS Aleksander is a uniquely designed "super-class" battlecruiser and the flagship of the UED Expeditionary Force during their invasion of the Koprulu Sector.  It is currently commanded by Admiral Gerard DuGalle with crewman Malmsteen at the helm. Before their initial strike against the occupying Dominion forces, the Aleksander was at a terran colony where the UED unleashed zerg upon a group of colonists as a means of observing the zerg in action. The Aleksander remained above the battlefield, never firing a shot. Satisfied with the demonstration, DuGalle ordered the ship leave the planet, leaving the colonists to their fate.<n/><n/>The Aleksander employs additional technology not seen in Confederate/Dominion era Behemoth-class battlecruisers.  Beyond employing cleaner fusion reactors to reduce leakage, the flagship uses a hyper-cycle cooldown applied to its laser batteries, allowing rapid firing, albeit with less initial impact damage, to its targets.  There are even rumors of an advanced FTL-based teleportation system that can quickly move the entire vessel a short distance in the blink of an eye.

Button/Tooltip/Arbiter=<c val="ffff8a">Specialized Protoss warship. Projects a field that cloaks all friendly units in its range. Can also use Stasis Field and Recall. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor Cannon</c><n/><n/>Lumbering but durable support vessels,arbiters are piloted by members of the Judicator Caste, and are infused with psionic energy. The Judicator uses the arbiter as a base to provide support using space-time manipulation. While capable of inflicting light damage. the arbiter is far more valued for its ability to create dynamic tactical advantages for the Great Fleet.<n/><n/>The Judicator can generate a large reality-warping field that serves to conceal nearby friendly units. The arbiter had to remain firmly anchored in space-time to generate the field and so is not concealed itself. Furthermore, arbiters can weaken space-time, tearing rifts in the fabric of space-time, creating a vortex linking another location to the arbiter's location. This can be used to move personnel and supplies over long distances. On the other hand, arbiters can also strengthen space-time and create discrete pockets of space-time, trapping objects and preventing those objects from interacting with objects outside of their pockets.
Button/Tooltip/Arbiter2=<c val="ffff8a">Protoss Arbiter Flagship. Projects a field that cloaks all friendly units in its range. Can also use Stasis Field,Recall, and Vortex. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor Cannon</c><n/><n/>While all Protoss Arbiters are shrouded in mystery and permeated by latent psionic energy, perhaps the most feared and shining example of this is the Danimoth.  Used primarily in high risk missions, the Protoss only deploy this flagship when they wish their forces to get in and out of a situation without a shred of detection.  The massive khaydarin crystals it carries allows it to recharge its temporal systems much faster than standard arbiters.<n/><n/>Capable of bending both space and time, few enemies of the Protoss have ever witnessed the Danimoth in person without being promptly torn asunder by the Conclaves special attack force cloaked nearby.
Button/Tooltip/Archon=<c val="ffff8a">Powerful psionic attacker.

When threatened with a squadron of smaller vessels, unleashing the volley of missiles allows a spread of equal punishment to all.<n/><n/>The Aleksander is equipped with advanced propulsion systems within its payload of missiles, capable of dealing increased impact and at a greater range.  However, the time to reload missiles becomes greater than standard missile complements.

Artanis fought the Zerg alongside his old comrade, Fenix, and earned the title of Praetor soon after the death of the Overmind.<n/><n/>Artanis harbors a deep respect and admiration for Tassadar. He hopes to become as great a leader as Tassadar; a path which, although noble, could cause him to forsake his better judgement.

Although materials are usually warped in from Aiur, vespene is still required for these materials to be produced and the creation of warp rifts.
Button/Tooltip/AutoTurret=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Automated defensive turret. Times out after <d ref="Behavior,AutoTurretTimedLife,Duration"/> seconds.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Auto turrets have long been used in defending Confederate installations from mercenaries and fringe colonists looking for a quick payday with great success.  However, they were ill suited to defend against the Sons of Korhal and the Zerg.  When the Dominion took hold of this technology they realized instead of re-deploying this, they could miniturize an auto turret to be manufactured aboard the Magellan.  In mid-flight, the cybernetic construct can rapidly launch an auto-turret projectile at an area where it quickly deploys and provides light resistance, or if anything, a distraction against incoming enemies.
Button/Tooltip/Banshee=<c val="ffff8a">Tactical-strike aircraft. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Backlash Rockets</c><n/><n/>The AH/G-24 Banshee Tactical-Strike Aircraft has been contracted out to Procyon Industries to meet requirements from the newly formed Terran Dominion for a dedicated ground attack aircraft for counter-insurgency operations. The Banshee is an entirely new design as adapting an existing design was unlikely to be satisfactory.  By the early months of the Dominion only several prototypes existed and several were actually stolen by mercenaries like Schezar's Scavagers in hit and run raids off Procyon's dry-dock facilities due to low security.<n/><n/>The banshee is powered by relatively low-thrust and inexpensive VTOL turbofans capable of operating only in an atmosphere. The turbofans are sturdy, simple in design, and relatively easy to maintain. They allow for indefinite loitering with minimal noise, which is perfect for stealth operations.  Engineers have contemplated it may be possible to outfit the Banshee with a cloaking system similar to the aging Confederate Wraith's, but for now, this remains in a pre-prototype design.
Button/Tooltip/Barracks=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Infantry-production facility.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Marines<n/>- Bunkers</c><n/><n/>The Barracks houses and trains all of the Terran infantry units.

Button/Tooltip/Battlecruiser=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Powerful warship. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Laser Batteries<n/>Yamato Cannon (limited availability)</c><n/><n/>The massive, Behemoth-Class Battlecruisers are virtual flying fortresses, built to keep the peace within the Terran Sector. Outfitted with multiple laser batteries and thick NeoSteel armor, these ships are easily the most powerful of the Colonial vessels. Many Colonial generals use Battlecruisers as their command centers during long space campaigns.
Button/Tooltip/BirthBroodQueen=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Defensive unit. Can use Spawn Larvae, Spawn Creep Tumor, and Transfusion. Moves much faster on creep. Can attack ground and air units. </c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Arachnis Brood-Keeper</c><n/><n/>Inspired from Kerrigan's first broodmother Zagara, Abathur altered the essence of the older breed of queen, and ultimately from the Arachnis brood-keeper, in order to create a creature similar to the Brood Mother, yet with less independent thought and analysis.  The queen's brain is encased in an armored skull, and connected to a set of nerve cords that bear resemblance to those possessed by protoss, giving it the ability to guide and nurture a Hive.
Button/Tooltip/BirthQueen=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Specialist unit. Can use Ensnare, Spawn Broodling, and Parasite.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Arachnis Brood-Keeper</c><n/><n/>A rapidly aging organism, the older Zerg Queen cannot command a Hive yet still has value within the Swarm. While it cannot produce larvae as their evolved counterparts, they can still spawn numerous other parasitic creatures. The Queen can also attack by expelling a voracious symbiote that rapidly slices its way through opposing forces. Since her lightly armored body leaves her vulnerable to attack, the Queen usually stays near the central hive to watch over maturing Zerg.<n/><n/>There are very few older Queens remaining in the Swarm, much of their DNA being re-constituted into the new Brood Queens.  Kerrigan has ordered Abathur to let their genome continue in the Swarm until the very last Queen has been killed.

Button/Tooltip/Brutalisk=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Massive assault beast that dwarfs even the Ultralisk in size and strength.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Unknown</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Brutalize</c><n/><n/>The Brutalisk was created using an aggressive variant strain of the Ultralisk which resembles a cross between a zergling and a hydralisk.  Unlike most zerg, the Brutalisk was not created intentionally by the Swarm.  Instead, it was unnaturally produced by the genetic testing of zerg bioessence through unknown means.  Although capable of evolving from the Ultralisk, few ever survived in doing so due to the incredible biological changes needing to occur. Those that did have become fearsome weapons of war with the ability to produce powerful bile attacks to ward off would be aerial attackers while still maintaining an even more vicious ground attack than the Ultralisk itself.  Brutalisks that were deemed failures have been jettisoned on various worlds, either living off the land without a master or eventually becoming re-captured and experimented on yet again in an endless cycle of enslavement.<n/><n/>While powerful, Brutalisks have a very slow movement rate. Fast-moving units easily dominate Brutalisks by utilizing hit and run tactics. Alternately, powerful weapons such as siege tanks and battlecruisers make short work of Brutalisks from afar.

Button/Tooltip/BuildCreepTumor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">A burrowed creep generator. Creep feeds nearby Zerg structures. A Creep Tumor can spawn additional Creep Tumors.</c><n/><n/>Recent evolutions made possible by Abathur have evolved the liquid globs of tissue creating noxious creep from brood queens into a more cohesive form.  This new form is self-regenerative, allowing creep to be generated from within.  The tumor is able to self-replicate itself to a new location on creep, leaving behind an imperfect copy, yet allowing creep to generate.  This tumor greatly benefits the Swarm's ability to spread creep and has seen the de-evolution of the creep colony because of it.  This increase in creep may allow more evolutions possible for when zerg are present on creep.
Button/Tooltip/BuildMachineShop=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Factory addon. Allows more Factory units and upgrades.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Siege Tanks</c><n/><n/>The Factory is primarily designed to assemble prefabricated vehicle designs and components.

Button/Tooltip/CancelCommanderLazarus=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Upon receiving near fatal damage, the Commander automatically becomes incapacitated briefly.  Upon regaining control, he will continue to recover health until full.  Cannot be used more than once every 120 seconds.</c><n/><n/><c val="DD0018">(The Commander has been recently restored.  This ability is still not available.)</c><n/><n/>Utilizing the latest in black market special research, brilliant yet paranoid fringe scientists have created what they dub the Lazarus Protocol.  Installed onboard a marine combat suit, when health is detected to be near critical levels the suit automatically powers down feigning death.  The suit then delivers a highly experimental and controversial set of drugs that bring the occupant to near death before rapidly regenerating any tissue damage done thus far.<n/><n/>Dominion scientists are aware of such drugs but have deemed them unsafe for standard marine use due to the "occasional" miscalculation of drugs used which instead outright kill the marine occupant instead of saving their life.
Button/Tooltip/Carrier=<c val="ffff8a">Capital ship. Can build and launch Interceptors to make attacks. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Interceptors</c><n/><n/>The massive Carriers serve as command centers for the leaders of the Protoss fleets. Heavily armored and shielded, Carriers can punch their way through enemy blockades by unleashing flights of robotic Interceptors at vital enemy targets. Although the Carriers have no weapon batteries or armaments of any kind, their deployment of Interceptor flights makes them devastating in ship to ship battle.
Button/Tooltip/CarrierTaldarim=<c val="ffff8a">Capital ship. Can build and launch Interceptors to make attacks. Allows two drones to repair broken mechanical units nearby.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Tal'darim Interceptors</c><n/><n/>Upon moving closer and closer to Shakuras and the remaining Protoss civilization, the Tal'darim quickly incapacitated and stole a number of new Carrier designs.  While standard constructed Carrier's have made their way into the Tal'darim fleets, a higher class with additional modifications has been given to higher ranking Tal'darim - Skylords.  <n/><n/>Boasting increased armor and a stronger interceptor attack, Skylords also produce something not commonly seen in Protoss designs, repair drones.  Any nearby robotic or craft that has been damaged through its shields and the repair drones will get to work immediately when in close proximity to the Skylord.  However, many Tal'darim agree it is wise not to linger too close to a Skylord as this can be a sign of weakness.  For this failure, they may unleash the interceptors upon the unlucky craft.
Button/Tooltip/CerebrateDaggoth=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Cerebrates are among the few Zerg with a unique personality. They relay the Overmind's will, commanding their Broods and directing minions in battle.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Original Zerg Strain</c><n/><n/>Cerebrates were descended from the original Zerg parasites of Zerus that existed before the coming of the Xel'Naga, albeit being much larger and endowed with much greater intelligence. Upon their creation by the Overmind, each Cerebrate and the Brood it led was given a specific role which in turn shaped the Cerebrate's personality. Cerebrates also oversaw the evolution of the Swarm.<n/><n/>Cerebrates further expanded the Zerg hierarchy and came to rely on Queens to oversee hive activity and Overlords to relay commands to and directly control the Brood's minions. While the rigid hierarchy ensured efficiency, the permanent death of a Cerebrate could induce a complete reversal. Broods that lost their Cerebrate frequently became uncontrollably destructive. <n/><n/>Externally, Cerebrates appeared as giant, bloated slug-larvae with numerous purple limbs protruding from the sides.
Button/Tooltip/Charge=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Fenix charges towards a unit at high speed.</c><n/><n/>Not one to shy away from battle, Praetor Fenix is usually found at the front lines of combat due to his advanced augmentation to his armor's leg enhancements which provides a momentary boost of speed.  This upgrade is currently being evaluated for deployment to all Zealots in the near future.<n/><n/>Protoss whom have sparred with Fenix before have stated the mighty templar charging toward them at lightning speed was "terrifying".

A standard marine would simply use the shield as an extra plate of armor but the Commander can expertly wield it to actually deflect against incoming projectiles quite effectively, shrugging off otherwise deadly attacks.  However, the shield provides little cover against the claws of a zergling or the blades of a zealot.

This new form is self-regenerative, allowing creep to be generated from within.  The tumor is able to self-replicate itself to a new location on creep, leaving behind an imperfect copy, yet allowing creep to generate.  This tumor greatly benefits the Swarm's ability to spread creep and has seen the de-evolution of the creep colony because of it.  This increase in creep may allow more evolutions possible for when zerg are present on creep.

The Protoss are such powerful psychics that they can inadvertently send out psychic “ripples” that are disruptive to other life forms. With careful training, Mojo has learned to focus these ripples into a storm of raw psychic energy that is capable of literally tearing apart the minds of lesser species.

Located deep within the Core are the mysterious essence translators that bond the spirits of fallen Protoss to the cold metal exoskeletons of the Dragoons.
Button/Tooltip/Daggoth=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Master of the Tiamat Brood, the largest and most powerful Brood within the Swarm.</c><n/></n>Like all Cerebrates, Daggoth was created to help the Overmind keep control over the Zerg Broods. Commanding the largest Zerg Brood, Tiamat, Daggoth serves the Overmind with ferocity and valour. Daggoth is easily one of the strongest willed Cerebrates, often advising other Cerebrates as to how they might best serve the Overmind.
Button/Tooltip/DarkArchon=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Powerful psionic being. Can use Feedback and can be upgraded to use Mind Control and Maelstrom.</c><n/><n/>Like their High Templar brethren, two Dark Templar can sacrifice themselves in a Psionic melding, giving rise to the Dark Archon. The powers of these avatars of Psionic might extend well beyond those of the regular Archon, more than compensating for their lack of any physical attack capability.<n/><n/>The burning, crimson effigy of the Dark Archon spreads fear across any battlefield. These powerful creatures of living Psionic energy embody the eternal wrath of the Dark Templar. The Dark Archon can wield the mysterious energies of the Void. These dire, volatile beings are so powerful that the Dark Templar have outlawed their creation for a thousand years.
Button/Tooltip/DarkArchonConfusion=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Forces enemy units in the target area to attack each other for <d ref="Behavior,DarkArchonConfusion,Duration"/> seconds.</c><n/><n/>Reaching deep into the chaotic force of the void, Raszagal can rapidly control the minds of an array of enemies nearby, causing them to strike at one another instead of her brethren.  However, the effect of so many minds enthralled at once is taxing, and victims are able to regain their senses after a short while.

Its original conception was designed to become a tower structure with defenses rivaling that of the Khalai photon cannons.  However, as research began with the energy crystals housed within, the Nerazim realized they should instead use these towers as places of study for the mysteries of the void.<n/><n/>Specially crafted shrines for master dark templar contain a powerful crystal known as the Eye of Adun.  These crystals are attuned to the essence of individual dark templar and can be linked to them across great distances.  In times of great urgency, a warp rift can open to allow the Nerazim to escape harm and return to the base of the tower, escaping certain death.  However, the effect is taxing on the crystal, and cannot be used again.

Button/Tooltip/DeepTunnel=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Allows Kerrigan to instantly move to another visible location on the map.  Will automatically target the closest Hatchery/Lair/Hive when near death.</c><n/><n/>As Kerrigan began evolving herself from her original infested state, she evolved a common Zerg technique, to quickly burrow underground.  However, the Queen of Blades took this a step further.  Using billions of tiny muscles at a low frequency, the Queen of Blades is able to break up earth, rock, and vegetation allowing her to "swim" through the ground.  Using a psionic aura around her she can almost "run" faster than she could above ground with nothing impeding her.<n/><n/>When wounded, Kerrigan is able to psionically locate the closest Zerg hive and focus only on getting there immediately for healing.  Although the technique can be used to practically any other known locations, Kerrigan prefers to wait until only absolutely necessary to escape combat as it requires extreme concentration and can only be used sparingly.
Button/Tooltip/DefensiveMatrix=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Casts a protective shield around a friendly unit for a period of time.</c><n/><n/>Confederate scientists are still working on creating stable, long-term force field generators, but early research has enabled the deployment of a short- lived defensive matrix that can absorb significant punishment.

Upon the theft of the Hyperion, Raynor took the vessel for significant modifications to avoid tracking and improvements to its systems.  In addition, he had this prototype addition installed in order to better weather attacks against the Hyperion's hull.

Button/Tooltip/DefilerMP=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Venomous specialist unit. Can use Dark Swarm and can be upgraded to use Consume and Plague.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorLightGrey">unknown</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Venom</c><n/><n/>Defilers are the perfect example of the fanatic and sadistic nature of the Zerg. Like the Larvae, the Defiler carries within it the genetic code of every other Zerg breed, but it does not produce them. To the contrary, the Defiler uses these genetic matrices to produce cancer-like toxins which have dramatic and deadly effects on the Zerg.<n/><n/>Although it would seem counter-productive for the Zerg to kill their own troops, the catastrophic effects produced by this forced devolution have been known to destroy legions of enemy troops.
Button/Tooltip/DefilerMPConsume=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Defiler feeds off of another Zerg unit, killing it and replenishing 50 energy.</c><n/><n/>As the only breed in the Swarm to show tendencies of cannibalism, the Defiler sometimes feeds off of its own species to regain lost energy. While this practice is particularly repulsive to most civilised species in the galaxy, it has proven to be an effective, if unsavoury, tactic.

Bypasses Protoss shields.</c><n/><n/>With this ability, the Defiler produces a batch of corrosive spores that it then explosively projects in a dense cloud around its enemies. This highly toxic cloud corrodes anything caught within its midst.
Button/Tooltip/DeploySpiderMines=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Spider Mines pursue enemy units that come in range, and detonate for heavy area damage. Buried Spider Mines can only be seen by enemy <c val="FFE303">Detectors</c>.</c><n/><n/>Spider mines were developed on Earth, and are one of the few technologies to survive the Long Sleep. Mines were deployed during the Guild Wars. One of the most proficient users was Victor Kachinsky, who became a Kel-Morian war hero as a result. Equipping vultures with spider mines became more popular in the late 2490's, especially on border worlds.  A spider mine burrows into the ground when deployed. When a target enters the range of its motion sensors, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>In 2499, Jaunt Pictures published the holomovie, Spider Mines IV: Death from Below, about sentient mines that turned against their creators. It was the last in the series.
Button/Tooltip/DevastatingShot=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Deals 200 damage to target unit or structure.

Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Eviscerator Rail Gun</c><n/><n/>The first diamondback prototypes were produced by the Terran Confederacy during the Great War, but never developed beyond that stage.  After the fall of the Confederacy, Omega Squadron retained a few remaining models that were not lost on Tarsonis.  Diamondbacks are fast, high-damage hovertanks. Rail Gun can fire while the Diamondback is moving.
Button/Tooltip/DisableOvercharge=Orders the Hyperion to disable its Overcharge, reducing attack speed and energy regeneration to normal and halts damage per second to itself.
Button/Tooltip/DisplacementField=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Allows Kazansky's wraith to evade 20% of incoming attacks while cloaked.</c><n/><n/>A prototype cloaking field developed by Magellan.  By changing the cloaking field frequency sporadically on the wraith, the targeting systems of most incoming projectiles, whether they be computerized or biological, cause an error which radically alters their course, causing up to a 20% "miss" rate.  Extremely expensive to produce, only Kazansky's wraith has been outfitted with such a device, most generals deeming only his life most worth saving from other less experienced pilots.  
Button/Tooltip/DisruptionWeb=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Casts a net of energy on the ground that prevents any unit or structure underneath from attacking.</c><n/><n/>Corsair pilots can focus their psychic energy through the vessel's Neutron Emitter, creating psionic static which disrupts neural impulses and renders computer-directed attacks inaccurate.

Button/Tooltip/Domination=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Zeratul takes control of a targeted unit. Mind Warp lasts until the controlled unit is either destroyed or Zeratul releases it manually.</c><n/><n/>Tapping into the more forbidden knowledge gleaned over by the Nerazim when studying the void, Zeratul is able to mentally force his way into the mind of a lesser being and subvert them to do his will. Dark Archons, the manifestation of the void merged with the Dark Templar, are able to enhance this ability further in order to permanently control the minds of more than one victim at a time, although the effect is taxing psionically even to them.<n/><n/>It has been theorized that absorbing more energy from the merging of other Dark Templar would allow a Dark Archon to become so powerful it could control countless minds at once with little repercussions in doing so.  In essence, the monstrous archon could control an army under its thrall if it so wanted.  This theory has been met with great concern over the Nerazim council and it has been initially suggested to forbid the use of creating more Dark Archons in the future.
Button/Tooltip/DragonKnight=<c val="ffff8a">Powerful Dragoon-replacement prototype.  Can attack ground units and withstand heavy attacks to shielding.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Historically, crippled veteran Templar could volunteer to continue serving by being transplanted into dragoon exoskeletons.  However, many saw the end times of the Dragoon fast approaching due to a single point of failure.  For it was only within a dedicated shrine on Aiur in which Dragoons could be constructed and warped via Gateway relays.  The purpose of this was more tradition and religion than actual practical use.  <n/><n/>Instead, phase-smith Karax began working on a new replacement Dragoon prototype that could be built directly on the battlefield within Robotics Bay's.  Scattered across random worlds and moons, the first of these prototypes were nicknamed "The Immortal Dragon Knights".   Karax saw a greater purpose to retrofit Dragoon photon cannons to bolster shields rather than be used for offense.  Although their new weaponry could not attack air units, their usefulness now allows them to protect their allies from any who would do them harm.
Button/Tooltip/Dragoon=<c val="ffff8a">Ranged support. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Veteran Protoss warriors who have been crippled or mortally wounded in combat can volunteer to continue their service to the Conclave by being transplanted into Dragoon exoskeletons. The shattered bodies of the volunteers are housed within large, mechanical walkers.<n/><n/>By focusing through the Khala, the fallen warriors can control the movements of the Dragoon as naturally as if they were within their former bodies.
Button/Tooltip/Drone=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Basic worker unit. Can harvest minerals and vespene gas. Can mutate into structures. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Gashyrr Wasp</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Spines</c><n/><n/>The savage Gashyrr Wasps of Eldersthine were initially inducted into the Swarm to serve as resource gatherers. Over time they became Drones, engineered with the Larvae’s ability to break down their own genetic coding and transform themselves into rudimentary Zerg structures. A transforming Drone needs the Creep to provide nourishment and mass to support its new form. <n/><n/>Like the Larvae, Drones are controlled by the Overlords who monitor their progress through a type of instinctive telepathy. Drones are also unusually single-minded about their tasks, diligently working even through raging combat.
Button/Tooltip/Dropship=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Air transport vehicle.</c><n/><n/>Heavily armored Dropships are a vital part of Colonial defense and are fully rated for both atmospheric and deep space flight. The daredevil pilots of these sometimes faulty, unreliable ships are charged with delivering Marine armor and infantry to any hotspot or combat zone. True to its name, the Dropship is capable of extremely rapid deployment. <n/><n/>Early experiments in equipping Dropships with weapons systems were scrapped in favour of greater carrying capacity.
Button/Tooltip/DropshipLoad=Loads units into the Dropship's hold.

By 64 years of age and with countless victories to his credit, he is considered to be the greatest military leader within the UED. DuGalle was unanimously nominated to command the UED expeditionary force, tasked with pacifying the Koprulu sector and removing the alien threat by any means necessary.
Button/Tooltip/Duke=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Commanding officer of Alpha Squadron.</c><n/><n/>General Edmund Duke has been a stalwart defender of the Confederacy for over forty years. Motivated by his love of power and control rather than any heartfelt political affiliation, Duke has earned a reputation for running things ‘by the book’. His long years of service with Alpha Squadron have left him with extensive tactical experience, making him one of the greatest military minds in the Terran Sector. <n/><n/>Despite his abilities, Duke’s ego and insufferable pride often lead to hostile confrontations with those under his command.

While the initial blast is quite deadly and can melt the armor off infantry and structure's alike, it also breaks down armor briefly, allowing additional attacks to damage the unit before the acid cools off.
Button/Tooltip/EMP=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Creates an electromagnetic pulse that drains all energy and shields from units in the targeted area.</c><n/><n/>By generating a massive, short-ranged electromagnetic pulse, the Explorer can disable shields and special electronics on any nearby units. Although the vessel creating the EMP is not affected, any friendly units within the radius of the EMP pulse are subject to its effects.

Button/Tooltip/Eredas=<c val="ffff8a">Elite Protoss Templar recovered from Aiur.  Can attack ground units and withstand heavy attacks to shielding.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Eredas was a protoss warrior, left wounded in stasis with two others on Aiur after its evacuation. He was the only survivor of three when an extremist group, the Fist of Ulrezaj, attacked the expedition sent to rescue them. <n/><n/>While the shrine on Aiur was destroyed to create new Dragoons, and with the current slowly diminishing in Protoss ranks, the council on Shakuras tasked Khalai engineers to devise a new cybernetic robotic model to place the battered body of Eredas.  They created a powerful new variant of the Dragoon, the Immortal.  While incapable of attacking air units like its Dragoon counterparts, Eredas' new form is able to fire twin phase cannons to make short work of ground targets.  Furthermore, a new experimental shield matrix was installed to withstand powerful impacts to shielding.
Button/Tooltip/EthanStewart=<c val="ffff8a">Powerful infested human that has a variety of corrosive abilities.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Corrosive Bolt</c><n/><n/>Ethan Stewart, a wealthy ex-mercenary leader, was the crime lord of Dead Man's Rock, a world seen as too far from the Terran Dominion to attract its attention. When he was human, Stewart had always known what he wanted and pursued it with a single-mindedness of purpose that stunned his allies and devastated his enemies.<n/><n/>That all came to an end when Stewart was captured by the Queen of Blades' zerg and transformed into a "successful" infested terran.  Unlike most other rapid infestation to humans that leaves them mindless husks, Stewart was believed to contain potent abilities and his cocoon was developed personally by Abathur.  However, this was soon discovered to be false as he was wearing a psi-screen, a device to block psionic beings. His mind was damaged by the psi-screen during infestation and could not be healed.  He was left partially mad and fell into infatuation with his new queen.<n/><n/>While Stewart has no psionic abilities, his infested form allows him to produce powerful corrosive abilities against his enemies, many of which were evolved from the now virtually extinct zerg Defiler.  However, Stewart must consume other zerg often to use them efficiently.
Button/Tooltip/EthanStewartBurrowed=Infested Terrans do moderate damage.<n/><n/><c val="FFFF8A">Can attack ground units.</c>

Button/Tooltip/Extractor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Mutated over a Vespene Geyser to allow harvesting of vespene gas.</c><n/><n/>Zerg rely on the high-energy state of Vespene gas to power their incredible metabolisms and fuel the accelerated growth of their larvae. The Extractor is essentially a giant organ that sits atop a Vespene geyser and packages the gas into small flesh-wrapped sacs that can be easily carried by Drones to a nearby Hatchery for absorption. Since the Extractor lives on Vespene gas itself, it does not need to be built on an area already covered in Creep.
Button/Tooltip/Factory=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Vehicle-production facility.</c> <n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Vultures</c><n/><n/>The massive, automated Factory is the primary production center for all Terran ground-based vehicles, from the speedy Vulture to the massive Siege Tank. Factories are heavily armored and mobile, but their tremendous import to a strong military presence makes them likely targets for enemy forces.

He is both cunning and powerful and has fought against the enemies of the Protoss in countless battles. Capable of strong empathy and tremendous rage, Fenix has long been one of Tassadar’s greatest supporters.<n/><n/>Fenix is distrustful of Aldaris and the Judicator caste, and thus relies only upon the honor of his fellow Templar warriors and his own unparalleled skill in the theater of battle.
Button/Tooltip/FenixBarrier=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Fenix overloads his Dragoon's shield capacitors, causing 20 health damage to himself, but rapidly regenerates his shields afterwards.  Lasts for 6 seconds.</c><n/><n/>By causing an overload in his shield's matrix weave, Fenix can cause them to rapidly regenerate to full strength.  While the effect takes a toll on Fenix himself, and can only be maintained briefly, it can spell the difference between life and death against certain situations.<n/><n/>A new meaning to "my life for Aiur" has come about from Fenix' demonstration of his loyalty towards his brethren.

The fate of the distant colonies mattered little to the UED, but the Zerg and the Protoss were the most dangerous threat the Earth had ever known. An expeditionary fleet was quickly formed with the best soldiers, generals and scientists of the Directorate.<n/><n/>The fleet's first objective was to complete the unification of Humanity by taking control of the Terran colonies. Then, the UED would command as many Zerg as possible through the weak, second Overmind and use them as weapons. The plan included a final step, the pacification of the Protoss, after the Zerg and the Terran were firmly brought under UED control.
Button/Tooltip/FleetBeacon=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Scouts, Carriers and Corsairs.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Carriers</c><n/><n/>Easily recognised, the Fleet Beacon is built around a huge sphere painstakingly carved from the largest and purest of Khaydarin crystals. The Beacon focuses Psi through this sphere to strengthen and magnify the warp rift created by the Stargate, allowing it to teleport the largest of the Protoss warships.

This armor also functions as a weapon, as the infestor can turn the inner layer of its carapace into a viscous fluid that breaks down matter in seconds and immobilizes anything it comes in contact with. This can be spewed over enemy targets with dire effects.
Button/Tooltip/Gantrithor=<c val="ffff8a">Tassadar's personal command ship. Pride of the Protoss fleet. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Interceptors</c><n/><n/>Tassadar exemplifies the growing rift within Protoss society. Born into a new generation that looks ahead to a dynamic future, Tassadar is frustrated by the stoic view that his elders hold of the past. Tassadar feels that the unbending nature of the Protoss and their inability to re-evaluate ancient traditions will be the doom of his race.<n/><n/>Fascinated by the power and mysticism of the renegade Dark Templar caste, Tassadar hopes to find some way to bridge the gap between these exiles and his masters.<n/>
Button/Tooltip/GantrithorInterceptor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Constructs Interceptors that automatically attack the Carrier's target. Carriers may not attack without Interceptors.

Corporate saboteurs stole the plans and sold them to Confederate interests, and to this day the Goliath is well-known along the Rim.<n/><n/>Featuring all-terrain maneuverability and a computer-based heavy-weapons systems, the Goliath is equally adept at providing both ground level and anti-air support. The use of Goliaths in the infamous Kel-Morian Mining Revolts showed just how effective even a small number of these versatile Combat Walkers can be when engaged in intensive urban warfare.

Button/Tooltip/GreaterNydusWorm=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Powerful Nydus worm strain capable of tunneling across incredible distances without creep.  Automatically spawns off-site zerg to its location periodically.  Lasts 60 seconds or until killed.</c><n/><n/>With massive amounts of biomass collected, a new strain of the Nydus worm has been created at the Queen of Blade's hive to allow even more zerg to pass through it at once as well as being able to even emerge off creep.  It accomplishes this by using triple the size fangs of normal Nydus worms that vibrate at higher than hypersonic speeds in order to crush soil, rocks and everything in between.<n/><n/>This huge creature is capable of stretching itself out to incredible lengths to support it's massive size with its own skin and ribs.  Nearby Zerg warriors can be transported quickly to the Queen of Blade's battlefield as the nydus worm can stretch indefinitely through on-demand tissue generation. 
Button/Tooltip/GreaterSpire=<c val="ffff8a">Contains upgrades for Zerg air units.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Guardians<n/>- Devourers</c><n/><n/>The armored Greater Spire carries the genetic code for the deadliest Zerg flyers and can be used to further enhance and evolve existing breeds. This structure enables the deadly Mutalisk to transform into its Guardian aspect, in which it sacrifices its speed and aerial assault to gain the ability to attack ground based enemies with devastating effect.

Hallucinations last <d ref="Behavior,HallucinationTimedLife,Duration"/> seconds before they disappear.</c><n/><n/>It is rumoured that some High Templar have learned to create illusionary duplicates of other beings. While these phantasms have no physical substance, they can be used to draw fire away from friendly units or sow confusion amongst enemy forces.
Button/Tooltip/Hatchery=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Primary structure. Used to spawn all Zerg units and receive gathered resources. Grows creep used to feed nearby Zerg structures. Can mutate into a Lair.</c><n/><n/>The Hatchery is the heart of any Zerg cluster. It acts not only as a resource return point and processing centre, but it produces the Larvae from which all other Zerg are spawned. Larvae are produced at a steady rate and will stay near the Hatchery of their creation. Like all Zerg structures, Hatcheries are living organisms that heal damage over time, making them very difficult to eradicate.<n/><n/>The Hatchery is the only structure that can be built without the benefit of existing Creep since it has been genetically designed to automatically produce enough to fuel its own growth. Creep Colonies, however, are required to extend this bio-matter further.

Button/Tooltip/Hellion=<c val="ffff8a">Fast scout. Has a flame attack that damages all enemy units in its line of fire.  Can attack ground units.</c></c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Infernal flamethrower</c><n/><n/>In use by 2490, the hellion was originally developed as an armored combat vehicle, but was deemed too cumbersome to be effective in its intended scout role. After it was stripped down to a bare-bones neosteel frame, engineers began reconstructing the hellion as a lightly armored vehicle, focused on speed and mobility. The hellion ended up becoming one of the best terran skirmishers in the Koprulu sector and beyond.<n/><n/>Hellions are capable of causing damage disproportionate to their size, particularly against enemy infantry, thanks to their heavy infernal flamethrowers.  This is directed using an antiquated targeting system.  The low cost, exceptional agility, and devastating firepower of these vehicles have made them extremely popular with mercenary companies.
Button/Tooltip/HighTemplar=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Potent psionic master. Can be upgraded to use Hallucination and Psionic Storm. Can merge with another High Templar to create an Archon.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Psi Assault</c><n/><n/>The High Templar are seasoned, veteran warriors of the Protoss armies. Respected and honoured throughout the Protoss Empire for their bravery and prowess, the Templar are ever vigilant against threats to the Protoss Homeworld of Aiur.<n/><n/>The High Templar have sacrificed the principles of martial training in order to more perfectly command the awesome psionic abilities that define their station.
Button/Tooltip/HighTemplarShakuras=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Powerful psionic being. Can use Feedback and can be upgraded to use Mind Control and Maelstrom.</c><n/><n/>Like their High Templar brethren, two Dark Templar can sacrifice themselves in a Psionic melding, giving rise to the Dark Archon. The powers of these avatars of Psionic might extend well beyond those of the regular Archon, more than compensating for their lack of any physical attack capability.<n/><n/>The burning, crimson effigy of the Dark Archon spreads fear across any battlefield. These powerful creatures of living Psionic energy embody the eternal wrath of the Dark Templar. The Dark Archon can wield the mysterious energies of the Void. These dire, volatile beings are so powerful that the Dark Templar have outlawed their creation for a thousand years.
Button/Tooltip/HighTemplarTaldarim=<c val="ffff8a">Potent psionic master. Can use Psionic Orb, Mind Blast, and Sacrifice.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Agonizing Blast</c><n/><n/>A high-ranking Tal'darim, Ascendants climb the Chain of Ascension by killing, directly or otherwise, their superiors in Rak'Shir duels. Ascendants are only second to the highlord in the Chain. The lower an ascendant's title, the higher their rank (e.g. First Ascendant is of higher rank than Second Ascendant).  After years of absorbing terrazine and having the advantage of using their supplicants' essence, they become very powerful.<n/><n/>Ascendants often dare one another to disable and commandeer an active colossus. If one succeeds, the Tal'darim gain a powerful war machine. If not, a rival ascendant has been eliminated. The most cunning ascendants utilize observers to spy on one another, in addition to the Tal'darim's enemies.
Button/Tooltip/HireShockDivision=<c val="FFFF8A">Heavy tank using powerful modified weaponry. Can switch to Siege Mode to provide long-range artillery support. Part of Mengsk's elite mercenary squadron.  Can attack ground units.<n/><n/></c>The Shock Division is an elite siege tank unit of the Terran Dominion Armed Forces.  While normal siege tankís utilize a powerful standard cannon, many siege tank drivers have cited their arclite weapon can be further enhanced for increased blast damage at the cost of safey and eventual explosion of the tank.  The response was the creation of a uniquely powerful custom tank that is able to withstand the kickback to the maximum power of the blast.  However, due to the heavy costs associated with such designs, only elite captains and generals (notably General Edmund Duke) may be allowed to pilot such vehicles.<n/><n/>Periodically, a group of no more than two drop-pods may be assigned from Dominion orbital command.
Button/Tooltip/Hive=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Further evolved version of the Hatchery that allows additional upgrades and structures to be produced. Also spawns all Zerg units and receives gathered resources.</c><n/><n/>The most evolved form of the Hatchery is the Hive. Protected by a dense exoskeleton and granted full access to the Overmind’s pool of knowledge, a Hive enables its cluster to produce the most sophisticated breeds and structures to be found within the Swarm.
Button/Tooltip/HotSLeviathan=<c val="ffff8a">Massive Zerg vessel. Can use Bio-Plasmid Discharge, Bio-Stasis, as well as spawn Mutalisks and Brood Lords at will.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Impaler Tentacle</c><n/><n/>Leviathans were once space-borne creatures before being infested by the zerg, turning them into armored carriers. They were used by the Swarm in war as early as the fall of Aiur.  Leviathans are essentially the zerg's equivalent of a capital ship.They are classified as class-10 zerg flyers and are the largest in terran records, even larger than a mothership,and have been referred to as "moon sized." Leviathans possess interior evolution chambers, can store tens of thousands of zerg strains within their interior chambers, and are capable of deep-space travel and can land on planets. They can operate in temperature conditions of near absolute zero and are capable of traveling through warp space.<n/><n/>Leviathans are typically armed with a daunting array of bio-weapons. Giant, hollow tentacles resembling those of the spine crawler can grab smaller craft or puncture the hulls of larger ships and insert zerg boarding parties. Most leviathans can launch bile swarms at their enemies, and unleash powerful bio-plasmid charges that deal devastating damage to their targets. Furthermore, coccoons birthed within the leviathan are capable of mutating into mutalisks and brood lords.  Leviathans rarely, if ever, travel alone.
Button/Tooltip/HotSRaptor=<c val="FFFF8A">Fast melee creature. Can attack ground units.  Births in a group of 3.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Zz'gashi Dune-runners</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Claws</c><n/><n/>The small, savage dune-runners of the sand-world Zz'gash were incorporated into the Zerg Swarm to serve as scouts and initial assault troops. Although the Zerglings are little more than feral animals, they work well in large groups under the command of larger Zerg warriors.<n/><n/>Zagara is able to spawn her own unique eggs with small genetic variations.  These particular zerglings are capable of  attacking and moving faster than normal zerglings.  When they hone in on their target nothing can stop them from ripping it to shreds.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Slothien</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Needle Spines</c><n/><n/>Created and used exclusively by Daggoth of the Tiamat Brood, Hunter Killers are a rare and powerful strain of Hydralisk. They sometimes serve as bodyguards for important Zerg entities.
Button/Tooltip/Hydralisk=<c val="ffff8a">High-damage ranged unit. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Slothien</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Needle Spines</c><n/><n/>The peaceful, herbivore herds of Slothien were assimilated into the Zerg Swarm in order to produce one of the most fierce and diabolical of the Zerg strains. The evolutionary matrix of the caterpillar-like Slothien was supercharged by the Overmind, twisting the hapless creatures into the nightmarish killers known as Hydralisks. These once mild creatures now hunger for blood and violence, and they are infamous for acting in a particularly sadistic fashion.<n/><n/>The spindly, snake-like Hydralisks house hundreds of armour piercing spines within their upper carapace plates. These spines can be fired in volleys at enemies approaching from either the ground or the air, and massed groups of Hydralisks should be approached with extreme caution.
Button/Tooltip/HydraliskDen=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Hydralisks.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Hydralisks</c><n/><n/>The Hydralisk Den bears only a passing resemblance to the nests of the once-peaceful Slothien that the Hydralisks were evolved from. The slime-covered walls of this vile place contain within them the knowledge necessary for a Hive cluster to produce Hydralisk warriors.
Button/Tooltip/Hyperion=<c val="ffff8a">Previously Mengsk's flagship, the Hyperion was stolen by Raynor after the fall of Tarsonis. </c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Laser Batteries<n/>Yamato Cannon</c><n/><n/>The Hyperion was originally a Confederate battlecruiser, which crash-landed on a fiery planet near Umojan Protectorate territory. Umojan forces secured the crash site and removed its tracking beacon. Over the next year, the battlecruiser was upgraded and modified slowly and methodically.<n/><n/>In 2491 the ship became part of Arcturus Mengsk's Rebellion of Korhal – Mengsk had allied with the Umojan Protectorate and was currently located at Umoja. As the Sons of Korhal was formed, the Hyperion became Mengsk's flagship.<n/><n/>During the assault on Tarsonis, Captain Jim Raynor and his troops defected from the Sons of Korhal. Desperately needing transport, Raynor's group headed to the Dylarian Shipyards of Dylar IV. The Hyperion was sent to stop them, but Raynor's forces were able to board and hijack the ship. The Hyperion now serves as the Raiders' mobile headquarters.
Button/Tooltip/HyperionKorhalRegen=The Hyperion powers down and starts repairing damage.  It cannot attack or move while in this state.

Button/Tooltip/Hyperjump=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">After <d time="6"/>, warps to the target location. The Aleksander is invulnerable while warping.  Does not require vision.</c><n/><n/>The incredible design of the UED flagship has led to countless rumors about its on board weapon and defensive systems.  While many of these rumors are simply wild conspiracy theories, one in particular has its foundation in truth - the tactical jump.  UED scientists were able to miniaturize an FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive allowing for instant jumps between points in space.<n/><n/>While the jumps serve as little value to move the UED flagship across great distances in the galaxy, they can however be used to strategically place the vessel in key locations across a battlefield.
Button/Tooltip/Immortal=<c val="ffff8a">Assault strider. Can use Barrier to absorb damage. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Cybernetic war machines, Immortals stem from dragoons. Historically, crippled veteran Templar could volunteer to continue serving by being transplanted into dragoon exoskeletons. This honored tradition was broken by the fall of Aiur when the shrine dedicated to dragoon creation was infested by the zerg. Following the Brood War, crippled templar were transplanted into the new immortal exoskeletons instead with fallen hero Eredas being the first. Others began to see common service by 2502. The remaining dragoons were transformed into immortals. As a result, immortals house some of the most skilled and venerable warriors of the protoss military.<n/><n/>Immortals are outfitted with two twin phase disruptors as their primary attack form; they give critical fire support to legions of zealots against ground targets, deployed when the protoss are faced with heavy enemy firepower. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents Immortals from engaging aerial targets. When deployed, immortals give critical support by eliminating enemy artillery and ranged attackers.  Immortals are equipped with armor weave that mitigates impacts through energy dissipation.  Additionally, the hardened shields used by immortals are created by intertwining spectrums and wavelengths of varying intensity. Through this, these shields are incredibly dense, able to mitigate powerful impacts such as siege tank rounds or the blades of an ultralisk, through energy dissipation.

Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>After stealing the Immortal technology from the Protoss on Shakuras, the Tal'darim created their own unstable yet incredibly powerful versions known as the Vanguards.  They are piloted by Tal'darim warriors that fell in battle. Disgraced in defeat, they are placed in a vanguard for one more chance to make up for their failure. They revel in causing as much destruction as they can before dying in service to their highlord. Using a powerful area of attack weapon system, the Vanguards are capable of turning entire groups of enemies into ash before they can even approach them.
Button/Tooltip/Impaler=<c val="ffff8a">Long-range anti-armor ambusher. Must burrow to attack. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Slothien</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Piercing Tentacle</c><n/><n/>Evolved from the Hydralisk, Impalers were rapidly created by Abathur as the Sunken Colony strain was nearly removed from the Swarm's genetic pool.  At its heart, the Impaler strain was part of an impaler colony, an ancestor of the sunken colony.  In order to activate this strain, a corresponding Impaler Den must be placed near a hive.<n/><n/>These creatures, like their Lurker cousins, can attack while only underground, but unleash a massive long range tentacle to deal piercing damage against heavily armored ground enemies.  While the evolution will all but be lost in a short time, while the Queen of Blades has access to them, a combination of the two strains usually means instant death for any ground assault force.
Button/Tooltip/ImpalerDen=<c val="ffff8a">Enables:</c><n/>- Impalers from Hydralisks<n/><n/>Housing the genetic DNA of the ancient impaler colony, a pre-cursor to all but defunct sunken colony, these dens are the only genetic link to evolving the Hydralisk into the Impaler.  They, as will the Impaler itself, will be lost to the Swarm in a short while as the genetic strain will be overpowered by newer more aggressive strains.

Button/Tooltip/IncreaseReaverCapacity=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the number of Scarabs that a Reaver can produce, store and fire from 5 to 10.</c><n/><n/>By installing a neoteric micro-manufacturing plant, the Reaver can increase the number of Scarabs that are stored within its hull.
Button/Tooltip/Infest=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Queen is able to infest a badly damaged Command Center. Once infested, the Command Center will be under your command and can produce explosive Infested Terrans.</c><n/><n/>The most feared of the Queen’s abilities is the power to Infest a Terran Command Center and bring its occupants under the Overmind’s control. The Queen must enter a badly damaged Command Center and saturate it with parasitic bio-toxins. Once infested, the Command Center’s occupants can be turned into mindless suicide soldiers.
Button/Tooltip/InfestedAbomination=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Durable units that deal heavy damage.  Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Unknown</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Pustulant Smash</c><n/><n/>The Aberration is a powerful infested terran variant with a thorny carapace and a lower half made of pincers.  These towering husks are former terrans who have undergone extreme mutation from the zerg hyper-evolutionary virus and possess class 5 bio-signatures.  Unlike most infestations, however, Aberrations are an unintentional mutation by the Swarm sometimes appearing in human encampments when creep completely defiles the land.<n/><n/>Some consider these creatures to be the pinnacle of how two species can merge together in a perverse harmony, others consider it a pure abomination.  In either case, the end result in an effective ground assault creature that towers over the battlefield to reach its target in order to smash it to pieces.  Most effective against armored units, Aberrations should usually only be approached by the air.

Button/Tooltip/InfestedStukov=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Once a vice admiral of the UED, Stukov is now infested and commands other Infested Terrans.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Alexi Stukov grew up on Earth and rose through military ranks of the United Earth Directorate alongside his friend and eventual Admiral, Gerard DuGalle.  When the discovery of alien species in the Koprulu Sector made it back to Earth, Stukov was appointed as second-in-command by DuGalle of an expeditionary force to bring the inhabitants under UED control.  Although successful briefly in overthrowing the standing Terran power of the Dominion and controlling the Zerg via an enslaved infant Overmind, the situation proved too volatile thanks to the manipulations of self-proclaimed queen of the zerg; Sarah Kerrigan.   As the UED tried to retreat back to Earth, the Zerg overtook them, right before DuGalle comitted suicide.<n/><n/>Stukov himself suffered a different fate.  After UED sympathiser Samir Duran, seamingly under Kerrigan's thrall, tricked DuGalle into believing Stukov a traitor and ordered his death, his coffin was ejected into deep space after his own funeral.  Stukov's death, however, was temporary.  Secretly having tracked the UED ship, his recently deceased body was captured by zerg under a renegade Cererate, Kaloth.  Believing Terrans to be the ultimate threat, Kaloth started an experiment in creating infested human leaders, to turn them against their own.  With his body still viable, Stukov was resurrected through a new form of infestation.  One that would leave his mind fully intact while turning him into a formidable bio-weapon.

Their bodies twisted and mutated to produce extremely unstable chemicals, infested soldiers long only to find the Swarm’s enemies and destroy them by detonating their own bodies in a cloud of toxic fluid. As with other Zerg ground units, an Infested Terran also has the ability to burrow.

Unlike most zerg strains, infestors have the ability to move while burrowed. Hardened plates of assimilated mold and fungus functions as a weapon, as the infestor can turn the inner layer of its carapace into a viscous fluid that breaks down matter in seconds and immobilizes anything it comes in contact with. Infestors are known to ingest infested marines to use as terror weapons on the battlefield, carrying them to a combat zone. The marines are stored in thick flesh cavities until the infestor regurgitates them to face their former compatriots, or anything else that might pose a threat to the Swarm.<n/><n/>Perhaps the infestor's most dangerous feature is the neural parasite, a symbiotic creature living within infestors that, when spat, attaches to an enemy and controls its mind for a short period of time. This is inserted through a parasitic stinger, a flexible appendage that is capable of boring through both natural and organic plating. The parasite then is then inserted directly into the target's central nervous system. The amorphous, multi-mouthed parasite cannot survive for long within a foreign body, but whatever horrific deeds the host carries out while under the influence of the Swarm will leave everlasting scars.

After his time in the Confederate Marine Corps and subsequent life as an outlaw, Raynor spent many years keeping the peace on the colony of Mar Sara. As Confederate enforcements became increasingly harsh, Raynor decided to join up with the Sons of Korhal.<n/><n/>Although he is new to the movement, Raynor has proven himself to be a dynamic leader and he is well liked and respected by the troops under his command. Despite his often sarcastic demeanour, Jim is fiercely loyal to the Sons of Korhal and will put it all on the line without hesitation.

On Char, Raynor's forces were overwhelmed by the Zerg. Raynor eventually joined forces with the Protoss expedition on Char, as both parties were struggling to survive.

A war veteran and a former outlaw himself, Raynor's reputation makes his job as Marshal relatively easy. </c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Anti-Personnel Fragmentation Grenades<n/>Spider Mines</c><n/><n/>Born a farm boy on the planet Shiloh, Jim Raynor enlisted in the Confederate Marine Corps during the Guild Wars at the age of 18.<n/><n/>Raynor was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment and during his eventful tour of duty on Turaxis II, eventually joined the newly-formed Special Tactics and Mission Platoon "Heaven's Devils" of the 321st Colonial Rangers Battalion.<n/><n/>Increased tensions between Raynor's squad and their commanding officer, Colonel Javier Vanderspool boiled over when the squad discovered their commander's dealings with the enemy and his subsequent attempt at killing his own troops to prevent them from getting in the way of his schemes. Eventually Vanderspool openly turned against his men. During a confrontation, Raynor shot Vanderspool in the chest.<n/><n/>Raynor and the other surviving members of Heaven's Devils abandoned the military and were charged with manslaughter in absentia. Following the war, they became outlaws, conducting heists across the Koprulu sector. Years later, Raynor came in contact with Myles Hammond, an old family friend and magistrate of the colony of Mar Sara. Being in a position to grant clemency to Raynor and erase his military and criminal records, Hammond offered Raynor a job as Colonial Marshal. Raynor accepted the offer.
Button/Tooltip/K5Cooldowns=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Creates a localized gravity well that telekinetically crushes a targeted mechanical unit, killing it instantly.</c><n/><n/>A powerful demonstration of her psionic superiority, Kerrigan can use the magnetic and gravitational forces around a mechanical unit and literally crush it against its own weight after lifting it from its stationary location. <n/><n/>The Queen of Blades is quite found of finding an overconfident Protoss Carrier or massive Terran Battlecruiser before crushing it into oblivion.
Button/Tooltip/K5CreepBonuses=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Your units and structures gain increased life regeneration and 30% increased movement and attack speed while on creep.<n/><n/>- Requires 250 biomass stored.</c><n/><n/>Creep is a living zerg superorganism. It has a purple coloration and is a viscous substance that feels thick and slimy. Creep is psionically-sensitive and may be influenced and controlled by psionic entities.  By using a significant amount of biomass, Kerrigan can evolve her hive creep's cellular structure to allow zerg ground strains to move faster over creep than normal ground due to a collection of microscopic filaments that allow them to 'skate' across creep rather than breaking through it.  It can also be used to nourish zerg structures, larvae, and other strains.

Launched from Kerrigan's personal Leviathan, Abathur prepares aging, yet incredibly strong, strains of zerg warriors that the old Zerg Cerebrates created in the Swarm so many years ago.  <n/><n/>Unfortunately the DNA of these creatures is extremely volatile and, as a side effect upon being outside of their spawning pools, are susceptible to severe tissue breakdown, causing these enhanced zerg to only be viable for a short time on the battlefield.  Larger breeds such as the mighty Torrasque strain will break down faster than smaller breeds, but the raw carnage these creatures can cause before this occurs is undeniable.

Unfortunately her true psionic potential became limited by this restrained design.  However, with her thoughts now her own, she has learned to evolve herself to unlock that potential by collecting potent bio-masses and special materials with psionic energy to evolve her own biology.  By constantly improving upon her own being, she can evolve herself into something greater than her simple infested beginnings.  Overtime, Kerrigan will become a creature with almost god-like powers that few will be able to match.
Button/Tooltip/K5ImprovedOverlords=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Overlords morph 70% faster and provide 50% more supply.<n/><n/>- Requires 125 biomass stored.</c><n/><n/>By combining a sizable stockpile of acquired biomass, Kerrigan can evolve her Overlords in her current Hive to not only grow faster than ever before but can exhibit greater control over her minions, allowing an impressive display of domination early into a battle.
Button/Tooltip/K5Leviathan=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Summons a mighty flying Leviathan with timed life. Deals massive damage, has energy-based abilities, and can birth mutalisks or brood lords. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Psionically reaching out to her Leviathan in orbit, the Queen of Blades is able to bend space-time itself in order to quickly summon a variant of her massive beast to her side in battle.  While not as large, the Leviathan brought to her side is no less as much of a threat as its parent.  Historically difficult to control, it takes an extremely powerful psi user to issue commands to the most powerful zerg air borne flyer on record.  Unfortunately the unnatural summoning from Kerrigan's psionics breaks down this Leviathan's tissue at an alarming rate, eventually killing them after a period of time.<n/><n/>Once brought to Kerrigan's side, the Leviathan attacks with four spine crawlers on its underbelly to impale any ground targets it comes across while capable of launching bile swarm projectiles against aerial foes.  When threatened with larger capital ships, the beast is capable of launching bioplasmid globes dealing massive damage and it may even put enemies in a form of biostasis, completely disabling them.  Most unique, and also terrifying, about the Queen of Blades's Leviathan is its ability to self-birth airborne cocoons which are able to spawn mutalisks and even brood lords to defend its mother fro those who would threaten her.
Button/Tooltip/K5TwoDrones=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Drones morph in groups of two at no additional cost and require less supply.<n/><n/>- Requires 375 biomass stored.</c><n/><n/>As with any Zerg hive cluster, drones are the backbone to which production is maintained.  In order to keep her hives thriving, Kerrigan can use massive amounts of biomass to speed up the morphing strain process the larva takes into a drone.  In fact, the speed is so great the larva can use the efficiency to split itself into two drones, instead of one.  This effect is not unlike its ability to do this for zerglings or scourges.  The value of doubling the speed of drone production cannot be understated for an enemy that wipes a colony out is themselves destroyed moments later when the zerg return in full force.

The Overmind sensed Kerrigan's formidable psychic powers and saw a great weapon against the Protoss and, perhaps, against the shackles placed on him by his Xel'naga master so long ago.  Kerrigan was captured and placed within a chrysalis, to be assimilated into the Swarm. Kerrigan was successfully infested and reborn, calling herself the "Queen of Blades".  Her psychic potential combined with the Zerg hyper-evolutionary virus transformed her into an incredible weapon against the enemies of the Swarm.<n/><n/>Following the Overmind's death on Aiur, Kerrigan was freed from its influence and began a series of manipulations against the Protoss on Shakuras and the Dominion on Korhal, including her old romantic partner, James Raynor, that ultimately crippled all opposition to her and allowed her to regain control of the entire Swarm.  By the time her intentions were made clear, it was too late and Kerrigan became the undisputed leader of the Zerg and supreme power in the Koprulu sector.<n/><n/>Mysteriously quiet recently, Kerrigan has been evolving the Swarm and herself, unlocking her true psionic potential.  She is poised to grow into a being far greater than the Overmind ever intended -  a being in which few could ever hope to match in power.

If the vessel's shields deplete, the beam is cancelled.</c><n/><n/>While attuning the raw energy brought forth by pylon clusters aboard the super carrier, a concentrated beam of unimaginable devastating power is able to become manifested and directed towards a single intended target to be burned or "purified" as the Protoss often state.  Anything caught in the beam's wake may also become incinerated.<n/><n/>Although the immense energy output is taxing to the vessel's integrity itself, the longer the effect can be maintained the more total damage is done.  Few things can withstand the effects of this weapon for long however.  When highly concentrated beams are fired in unison from low orbit by multiple super carriers, the effects can incinerate entire worlds, extinguishing all life.

She is now capable of conjuring up an incredible amount of psionic energy to decimate all enemies in a very large area in front of her while simultaneously protecting her own zerg from the damage.  To accomplish this feat takes nearly all of the queen's energy as it pushes the limits of her infested design.<n/><n/>While this ability has been extremely rare to be seen used by the Queen of Blades due to its taxing nature on her, those who have seen her do this were quickly obliterated into ash before they could report back.
Button/Tooltip/KhaydarinMonolith=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Extremely powerful defensive structure. Has superior range and damage but is very expensive.

Focusing void energy upon huge khaydarin crystals, these massive towers can obliterate most lesser non-protected enemies with a single blast.  However its power is also its weakness - for lesser creatures rushing its base can quickly bring the tower down due to the time needed to recharge the crystal.<n/><n/>Historically, these monoliths are self-standing structures built by hand from the Nerazim and powered via underground pylon matrix energy.  However, with the recent Khalai refugees coming into Shakuras, many phase-smiths have begun to study these structures to see if they could be incorporated into more widespread use beyond Shakuras and replicated to be used with nexus warp fields.

All remaining Confederate troops stationed on the platform had either been killed or abandoned their post as the Zerg invaded.  No transports from the surface were able to successfully land on the platform.  <n/><n/>As the remaining Confederate forces were being decimated by the Zerg below, Arcturus Mengsk's armada, still orbiting the ravaged planet, managed to secure the platform for itself and reactivate the weapon.  Against recommendations from General Duke, Mengsk ordered the weapon to fire not only on the Zerg in order for them to make their escape back to Korhal, but on his former allies, James Raynor and the Magistrate, should they try to flee from being imprisoned for the crime of mutiny.<n/><n/>Ion cannons fire beams of negatively charged ions, doing heavy damage to armored targets.  Although rarely seen on Terran stations, these weapons can cause tremendous damage at long range, but are incredibly slow to fire.  They are most vulnerable when attacked from nearby on the ground, as they have no natural defenses against short-ranged attacks.

Although their size and toughness were greatly boosted by the Xel’Naga during their experiments, they still possess the two traits that originally intrigued the ancient masters: genetic versatility and psychic sensitivity. <n/><n/>Each larva contains within it the genetic makeup of every other Zerg breed. A young hive will only have the genetic code for the most basic of Zerg breeds, such as the Drone, but as it grows and develops new structures, the larvae can expand their library of genetic strains. With a command from the Overmind, the larvae will enter a pupal state and begin the metamorphosis into whichever breed is required by the hive.

The suit then delivers a highly experimental and controversial set of drugs that bring the occupant to near death before rapidly regenerating any tissue damage done thus far.<n/><n/>Dominion scientists are aware of such drugs but have deemed them unsafe for standard marine use due to the "occasional" miscalculation of drugs used which instead outright kill the marine occupant instead of saving their life.

Containing the best essences from Protoss with some Zerg influences, Maar could corrupt or mind control other protoss.  Used as one of Duran's trusted Hybrid generals, Maar began leading other newly awakened Hybrids on a quest to silence the protoss preservers around the sector.  He also ordered the incredible living weapon, Ulrezaj, to accomplish this task as well.<n/><n/>Most disturbing, Maar is able to regenerate at incredible rates, recreating his physical body when killed, by siphoning energy from other preservers he had imprisoned in a stasis field. He could also teleport long distances to avoid being killed.  However, Maar is most vulnerable when relying too heavily on preserver regeneration.  If within mid-regeneration while draining energy, it is possible he can be permanently killed.

Realizing the Dominion needed a greater combat unit better able to defeat zerg carapaces the 5-4 Armored Infantry Suit was developed from the firebat's CMC-660 and equipped with two Quad K12 "Punisher" grenade launchers on each arm. The suit's grenade auto-loader is stocked with components that allow it to manufacture and load hundreds of standard Punisher grenades.<n/><n/>Still in a prototype stage, these suits have never seen actual combat while the Dominion continues to test the rigors of the grenade launchers against the suits armor to determine the right blast recoil until the combat suit explodes, often with the helpless criminal pilot still inside.

He first saw combat on Sonyan early in the Guild Wars where he quickly made first lieutenant under Arcturus Mengsk where the two became friends.  After the war, Warfield became disenchanted as he carried out Confederate "peacekeeping" duties. When the nuclear destruction of Korhal occurred Warfield immediately deserted the Confederacy. Within a short time, Warfield established contact with the rebel group "The Sons of Korhal".<n/><n/>Warfield's intimate knowledge of the Confederacy's military strength, position, and movements was invaluable to the success of the rebellion.  During the Great War, it is rumored that Warfield's assistance may have led to rebel recovery of the psi-emitter on Mar Sara, and their use on Tarsonis.  As the newly formed Terran Dominion took hold over the Koprulu Sector, Warfield became a general in the Dominion Armed Forces and was seen as one of the more trusted advisors to the new emperor. Mengsk trusted Warfield with his most crucial tasks, strategies, and missions.  Later, during the Brood War, General Edmund Duke referred to Warfield as "the emperor's other brat," insinuating that Warfield was not in Augustgrad when the zerg betrayed the Dominion after the city's reclamation from the UED.

Button/Tooltip/Medivac=Air transport. Heals nearby biological units. Can use Afterburners.
Button/Tooltip/Medivac2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Air transport vehicle.</c><n/><n/>Heavily armored Dropships are a vital part of Colonial defense and are fully rated for both atmospheric and deep space flight. The daredevil pilots of these sometimes faulty, unreliable ships are charged with delivering Marine armor and infantry to any hotspot or combat zone. True to its name, the Dropship is capable of extremely rapid deployment. <n/><n/>Early experiments in equipping Dropships with weapons systems were scrapped in favour of greater carrying capacity.
Button/Tooltip/Mengsk=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Leader of the rebel group Sons of Korhal.</c><n/><n/>Arcturus Mengsk was once a successful Prospector for the Confederate government. Although his homeworld, Korhal IV, was a hotbed of civil violence and anti-Confederate sentiment, Arcturus served his government with courage and honor. As the civil turmoil reached the boiling point on Korhal, the Confederates launched a salvo of Apocalypse-Class nuclear missiles at the inflamed colony. Korhal IV was devastated, leaving Arcturus with only ghosts of the family and life he once knew. He immediately resigned his Prospector commission and vowed to bring down the Confederate government that destroyed his life. Gathering many of the survivors of the Korhal catastrophe, Arcturus founded a militant terrorist group known as the Sons of Korhal to aid him in bringing down the hated Confederates.<n/><n/>In his efforts to undermine Confederate authority, Mengsk’s methods and tactics range from harsh to nefarious. Heralded by radicals as a visionary and a patriot, Mengsk is seen by the Confederacy as a terrorist and a madman.
Button/Tooltip/MengskBC=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Powerful warship. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Apocalypse-class laser batteries<n/>Missile Pods</c><n/><n/>The CSF Ragnorak was a Confederate Behemoth-class battlecruiser of the Colonial Fleet, captained by Captain Bolshev.  When the destruction of Tarsonis occurred, Bolshev immediately deserted the Confederate army, took the ship and established contact with the leader of the Sons of Korhal, Arcturus Mengsk.  Bolshev offered his years of Confederate tactical knowledge as well as the Ragnarok itself; Mengsk decided the latter was sufficient enough and had Bolshev executed for "lack of loyalty".<n/><n/>General Warfield was presented with the Ragnarok as a token of his friendship with the new emperor.  Hand-picking the entire crew, Warfield trained each one personally to ensure all were battle hardened and ready at a moments notice.  The Dominion had the massive cruiser retrofitted to include the latest prototypes available.  Unlike the standard Behemoth-class weapon complements, the Ragnarok contains twin cruiser cannons that can make short work of targets as well as deploying side anti-air missile pods for additional support when under heavy aerial combat.  The impressive firing speed of the cruiser cannons has already begun research into applying this into the next Battlecruiser class to improve its effectiveness in battle.
Button/Tooltip/MengskFirebat=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Gui Montag is a reckless yet valued asset of the Dominion's Omega Squadron. Can attack ground units, particularly effective against  organics.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">CMC-660 Heavy Combat  Suit<n/>Plasma-based Firestorm Flame Throwers</c><n/><n/>Long best friends with the Commander from Mar Sara, Gui Montag was a corporal during the Confederacy's Omega Squadron's self proclaimed "epic"  victory over Tal Qirat.  He survived the destruction of Omega Squadron during the zerg invasion of Tarsonis by burning a path of zerg in front of him until he fled the planet with a handful of survivors.  He was soon conscripted and became first sergeant in the Dominion's new Omega Squadron once Mengsk came to power.  Gui met up with his former friend once the Commander was brought in, although against his will, to lead Alpha Squadron.<n/><n/>Gui is highly distrustful of any government, be it the Confederacy or the Dominon.  He is often found first in combat and rarely seen as the last man out.  Taking pride in his custom flamethrower weaponry, the Dominion has taken great notice in seeking new improvements to their firebat armament based on Gui's designs.
Button/Tooltip/MengskMarine=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Commander has great tactical sense and impressive combat abilities. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">CMC-300/400 Powered Combat Suit<n/>8mm AGR-14 "Impaler" Gauss Rifle</c><n/><n/>Known only as "The Commander" to those who have met him, his identity remains a closely guarded secret.  Displaying a keen sense of leadership, he quickly rose the ranks from within the Confederacy and was promoted to the title of 'Magistrate' on the colony of Mar Sara.  Soon after taking the position, however, the Zerg invaded and he became increasingly frustrated with the lack of empathy the Confederate government had toward the colonists suffering.<n/><n/>En route to relocating colonists away from ravaged towns, he met a local marshall; James Raynor.  He too shared a disillusion with the Confederacy and together they joined Arcturus Mengsk and the Son's of Korhal to lead a revolution.  However, that alliance came to an end when Mengsk betrayed his own and left his most trusted lieutenant, Sarah Kerrigan, to the Zerg.<n/><n/>The Commander helped Raynor escape from Mengsk and his newly founded Dominion government over the ashes of the Confederacy.  However, the two had a disagreement when Raynor was convinced Kerrigan was being held captive on Char by the Zerg.  Believing Raynor to be blinded by his feeligns, they went their separate ways.  Unfortunately, the Commander was found soon after and arrested for treason.  Instead of a public execution, Mengsk realized his talents should not be wasted and was reinstated as Commander to the Dominion's new Alpha Squadron.
Button/Tooltip/MengskMedic=<c val="FFFF8A">Support trooper. Heals nearby biological units using advanced medical equipment. Part of an elite mercenary squadron.  Cannot attack.<n/><n/></c>Using more advanced medical technology than their standard Koprulu medic issued equipment, Field Response Theta is a unit of elite medics under the Dominion Armed Forces.  Though their value to heal front line infantry forces has been seen as invaluable, the Dominion has failed to incorporate their technology into the main division of the armed forces, only being used for special ops.<n/><n/>Due to cost concerns, a group of no more than four drop-pods may be assigned from Dominion orbital command.
Button/Tooltip/MengskSiegeTank=<c val="FFFF8A">Heavy tank using powerful modified weaponry. Can switch to Siege Mode to provide long-range artillery support. Part of an elite mercenary squadron.  Can attack ground units.<n/><n/></c>The Shock Division is an elite siege tank unit of the Terran Dominion Armed Forces.  While normal siege tankís utilize a powerful standard cannon, many siege tank drivers have cited their arclite weapon can be further enhanced for increased blast damage at the cost of safey and eventual explosion of the tank.  The response was the creation of a uniquely powerful custom tank that is able to withstand the kickback to the maximum power of the blast.  However, due to the heavy costs associated with such designs, only elite captains and generals (notably General Edmund Duke) may be allowed to pilot such vehicles.<n/><n/>Periodically, a group of no more than two drop-pods may be assigned from Dominion orbital command.

He has little patience for those who don't know how or refuse the get the job done.  While Dominion leadership disapproves of his lack of protocol for the chain of command, they can't argue his effectiveness.
Button/Tooltip/MercCompound=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Experimental arms researcher.  Allows purchase of special upgrades and units.</c><n/><n/>Since the inception of the Confederacy, there has always existed a special black market for mercenaries that make use of experimental weapons and armor that are deemed too dangerous to be made legal, mostly, due to the fact that many soldiers are not experienced enough to handle the modifications.  The Commander, however, is an expert weapons specialist and is well trained to make good use of the modifications.
Button/Tooltip/MindControl=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Permanently converts targeted enemy unit to player control.</c><n/><n/>Mind control is a type of psionic power. Protoss Judicators could use their powers to subtly influence the minds of other creatures. Dark Archons, however, through an immense expenditure of energy, are able to project a portion of their psychic essence into another being, gaining control over its actions and access to its memories.
Button/Tooltip/MineralField=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Workers can harvest resources from this Mineral Field.</c><n/><n/>The planets along the rim are often dotted with clusters of precious Mineral crystals. These Minerals are smelted down and used to create the armored hulls of starships, vehicles and personal armor. Even the Zerg require Minerals to harden their carapaces and develop strong teeth and bones.<n/><n/>The Mineral crystals take some time to gather, and only SCVs, Drones, and Probes have the necessary equipment to break off bits of the crystals and return them to the proper building.
Button/Tooltip/MissileBarrage=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">An auxiliary missile is fired from General Duke's tank, dealing 100 damage to all ground units in a target area.</c><n/><n/>Although already equipped with incredible firepower using his customized Arclite Siege Tank, General Duke has loaded explosive javelin-class missiles that can be fired from rear launch bays against ground targets in an area.  These missiles can be fired while on the move or when sieged, making them a vital resource to use when numerous smaller enemies present a threat.  Care should be used however, as the missiles have no IFF targeting system, and will damage enemies and allies alike.
Button/Tooltip/MissilePods=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Missile Pods deal <d ref="Effect,HurricaneMissileDamage,Amount * Effect,HurricaneMissileDamagePersistent,PeriodCount"/> damage to air units in target area.</c><n/><n/>When standard ATA and ATS laser batteries are too slow to get the job done, some Generals order hurricane-class missile pods as a complementary weapon system.  When threatened with a squadron of smaller vessels, unleashing the volley of missiles allows a spread of equal punishment to all.

Can attack ground units and withstand heavy attacks to shielding.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Eredas was a protoss warrior, left wounded in stasis with two others on Aiur after its evacuation. He was the only survivor of three when an extremist group, the Fist of Ulrezaj, attacked the expedition sent to rescue them. <n/><n/>While the shrine on Aiur was destroyed to create new Dragoons, and with the current slowly diminishing in Protoss ranks, the council on Shakuras tasked Khalai engineers to devise a new cybernetic robotic model to place the battered body of Eredas.  They created a powerful new variant of the Dragoon, the Immortal.  While incapable of attacking air units like its Dragoon counterparts, Eredas' new form is able to fire twin phase canons to make short work of ground targets.  Furthermore, a new experimental shield matrix was installed to withstand powerful impacts to shielding.
Button/Tooltip/Mojo=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Elite high-speed fighter. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Dual Photon Blasters<n/>Anti-Matter Missiles</c><n/><n/>Mojo is a Praetor of the Protoss Expeditionary Force, tasked with exploring new worlds and races in the Koprulu sector that could be deemed a threat to the Protoss.  Upon investigating Protoss energy signatures coming from Halcyon, his force was quickly overwhelmed by a combined force of both Zerg and Terran, belonging to Schezar's Scavengers.  Captured and experimented on, Mojo's forces were almost wiped out if not for the brave actions of the ex-Dominion Commander coming to his aid.  <n/><n/>Mojo is a powerful psionic and has been asked to join the High Templar ranks but prefers to command his own personal Scout vessel for direct combat.  However, Mojo has been noted to gather psionic energy around his vessel to conjure storms when surrounded by enemies.
Button/Tooltip/Monitor=<c val="ffff8a">Robotic support unit. Can use Target Lock, Squad Sight, and Force Field.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">None</c><n/><n/>Used to support zealots in light of the protoss race's diminishing population, sentries are protoss combat drones. The Tal'darim stole a number of sentries from the Daelaam and reprogrammed them, replacing their shield generators with on-board targeting systems. 
Button/Tooltip/MontagGauntlets=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases Gui's damage output and radius than standard firebat weaponry.</c><n/><n/>Gui's love of fire inspired him to develop his own modifications to his flamethrower.  Dominion scientists are researching how the modifications can be applied to future mainstream firebat flamethrowers without causing a 45% failure rate that overheats the nozzle and explodes.  <n/><n/>However, Gui's custom flamethrower has lowered the failure rate down to less than 1%, although the chemical fumes into the combat suit can reach critical health concern levels.
Button/Tooltip/MorphMorphalisk=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Target Hatchery, Lair, or Hive spawns four Larvae in <d ref="Behavior,QueenSpawnLarvaTimer,Duration"/> seconds.</c><n/><n/>The Brood Queen has evolved her protein-based substance, normally to stimulate cellular growth, to combine it with a catalyst secreted by a gland located on the queen's neck and forcefully injects it into a hatchery.  By doing this, larvae will be incubated more rapidly.  This ability has been of great interest to the Queen of Blades, as it allows her army to rapidly grow from her numerous larvae spawn points.
Button/Tooltip/MorphToHotSTorrasque=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Massive assault beast that dwarfs even the Ultralisk in size and strength.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Unknown</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Brutalize</c><n/><n/>The Brutalisk was created using an aggressive variant strain of the Ultralisk which resembles a cross between a zergling and a hydralisk.  Unlike most zerg, the Brutalisk was not created intentionally by the Swarm.  Instead, it was unnaturally produced by the genetic testing of zerg bioessence through unknown means.  Although capable of evolving from the Ultralisk, few ever survived in doing so due to the incredible biological changes needing to occur. Those that did have become fearsome weapons of war with the ability to produce powerful bile attacks to ward off would be aerial attackers while still maintaining an even more vicious ground attack than the Ultralisk itself.  Brutalisks that were deemed failures have been jettisoned on various worlds, either living off the land without a master or eventually becoming re-captured and experimented on yet again in an endless cycle of enslavement.<n/><n/>While powerful, Brutalisks have a very slow movement rate. Fast-moving units easily dominate Brutalisks by utilizing hit and run tactics. Alternately, powerful weapons such as siege tanks and battlecruisers make short work of Brutalisks from afar.
Button/Tooltip/MorphtoDefiler=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Venomous specialist unit.

Like the Larvae, the Defiler carries within it the genetic code of every other Zerg breed, but it does not produce them. To the contrary, the Defiler uses these genetic matrices to produce cancer-like toxins which have dramatic and deadly effects on the Zerg.<n/><n/>Although it would seem counter-productive for the Zerg to kill their own troops, the catastrophic effects produced by this forced devolution have been known to destroy legions of enemy troops.
Button/Tooltip/MultiLockTargetingSystem2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Schezar's goliath can target ground and air units simultaneously.</c><n/><n/>Although goliaths are capable of attacking both ground and air using different weaponry, standard Dominion and UED goliaths are only capable of locking onto a single target at a time.  By bribing LARS corp into designing a new type of dual-computer lock system, Schezar's specially constructed goliath can use two locking trackers onto both of its weapons, allowing to fire on both ground and air untis together.
Button/Tooltip/MuscularAugments=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the movement speed of Hydralisks.</c><n/><n/>Hydralisks can be genetically altered for increased musculature such that their rate of locomotion is greatly enhanced.

The Infestor cannot take any other action while controlling an enemy unit.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Channeled ability.</c></c><n/><n/>Perhaps the infestor's most dangerous feature is the neural parasite, a symbiotic creature living within infestors that, when spat, attaches to an enemy and controls its mind for a short period of time. This is inserted through a parasitic stinger, a flexible appendage that is capable of boring through both natural and organic plating. The parasite then is then inserted directly into the target's central nervous system. The amorphous, multi-mouthed parasite cannot survive for long within a foreign body, but whatever horrific deeds the host carries out while under the influence of the Swarm will leave everlasting scars.

The neural processing treatments that were used to dampen and pacify her latent psychic powers left her a withdrawn and introverted young girl. Forced to murder countless enemies of her Confederate masters, Kerrigan was finally exposed to a series of clandestine experiments conducted by the Confederate Government.<n/><n/>During a raid on a remote Terran outpost, Arcturus Mengsk discovered and rescued Kerrigan from the Confederate scientists. The Confederates had ruined both their lives, and it was a simple matter to convince the young woman to lend her formidable combat skills to his cause. Although Kerrigan is often called upon to be an executioner, she has never fully embraced the darker aspect of her true nature.
Button/Tooltip/NovaArmorJumpSuit=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Allows the Commander to jump up and down cliffs.  Also passively upgrades movement speed by 25%.<n/></c><n/>In the early days of the Confederacy these types jet packs (alternatively referred to as "jump packs") were capable of full flight. Crashes and fatalities were common among new "recruits" as the unwieldy booster proved difficult to control. The hardware was also known to randomly explode due to poor distribution of fuel lines and air intakes, leading them to be banned among the Confederate army.  <n/><n/>Schezar researchers have rediscovered this technology leading to a complete overhaul. A prototype of a flightless, twin-turbine jump pack was created which, in addition to boosting ground movement significantly, is capable of quick bursts of flight allowing effortless ascending and descending through terrain heights.

Button/Tooltip/NukeCalldown=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Calls down a Nuclear Strike at a target location. Nukes take 20 seconds to land, but they deal 500+ damage to enemies in a large radius.</c><n/><n/>One of the primary responsibilities of the Ghost is to locate enemy units or structures for tactical nuclear strikes. Using a special frequency targeting laser, the Ghost can direct missiles from any friendly silos with pinpoint accuracy.
Button/Tooltip/NukeSilo=Super-heavy ordinance production, storage, and launch facility.
Button/Tooltip/NydusCanal=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Friendly ground units can use a Nydus Canal to instantly travel to any other Canal within the Nydus Network owned by the player.</c><n/><n/>The precise origin of the Nydus Canal is unknown, and the exact process of its operation is also a mystery. The initial canal entrance is created and then, when a suitable site is found, a sister entrance can be opened. The Canal then enables Zerg ground units to travel from one end to the other at extremely high speed regardless of intervening terrain.<n/><n/>This enables multiple Hatcheries located across a large area to function as one unified nest, with Zerg warriors travelling from one combat zone to another quickly and efficiently.

Button/Tooltip/OblivionRecall=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Zeratul will be automatically teleported to a Dark Shrine upon near-death.  Can only be used once.</c><n/><n/>An ancient Nerazim structure, these dark obelisks represent the heart of the Shakuras culture. Its original conception was designed to become a tower structure with defenses rivaling that of the Khalai photon cannons.  However, as research began with the energy crystals housed within, the Nerazim realized they should instead use these towers as places of study for the mysterious of the void.<n/><n/>Specially crafted shrines for master dark templar contain a powerful crystal known as the Eye of Adun.  These crystals are attuned to the essence of individual dark templar and can be linked to them across great distances.  In times of great urgency, a warp rift can open to allow the Nerazim to escape harm and return to the base of the tower, escaping certain death.  However, the effect is taxing on the crystal, and cannot be used again.
Button/Tooltip/Observatory=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Observers.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Observers</c><n/><n/>History is of vital importance to the Protoss, as they believe that great events echo across space-time and serve as lessons for those wise enough to study them. Even during the Aeon of Strife, Protoss scribes recorded the wars and their heroes for future reference.<n/><n/>The Observatory is a modern refinement of the ancient scribe library, and it is here that the data gathered by the robot Observers is recorded and catalogued for study by future generations of Protoss.
Button/Tooltip/Observer=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Flying spy. Cloak renders the unit invisible to enemies without detection.</c><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c><n/><n/>These small drones are employed to survey vast wasteland areas or observe and record battles for study within the Archives. Their complex sensor array leaves little energy for defenses, but they can detect cloaked or concealed units with ease, making them invaluable on the battlefield.<n/><n/>Observers that are used for deep-space exploration are often deployed without any defensive systems, but when used in a combat zone they are equipped with a micro-cloaking field to hide them from the enemy. Like the Arbiter, the Observer does not require any additional energy to maintain the field.
Button/Tooltip/OmegaStorm=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Summons a storm that deals damage to enemies in an area.</c><n/><n/>Kerrigan can concentrate enough psionic energy to summon a deadly psionic storm, a technique resembling that of the Protoss High Templar.

Larger and faster than the more common Ultralisk, whole squadrons of infantry and artillery are required to down it.
Button/Tooltip/OpticalFlare=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Fires a flash grenade, blinding the targeted unit and removing detection abilities.</c><n/><n/>UED Medics armed with the A-13 Grenade Launcher can fire flash grenades to blind enemy troops.
Button/Tooltip/OrbitalCommand=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Command Center addon. Enables use of Scanner Sweep, which reveals any part of the map for a short time and detects cloaked and burrowed units.</c><n/><n/>This auxiliary building provides the Command Center with improved communications and scanning technologies.
Button/Tooltip/OverchargeOn=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Hyperion can overload its ATA and ATS laser batteries to fire rapidly against incoming targets.  However, in doing so, the Hyperion will take hull damage and lose energy per second while the effect is maintained.  Can be turned on and off at will.</c><n/><n/>Traditional Behemoth-class laser batteries were designed to fire moderately paced volleys of energy towards a target, favoring damage output over speed.  However, several modifications can be done to alter the containment fields of the batteries in order for them to achieve the same damage while increasing significantly its ability to fire.  <n/><n/>One significant drawback, however, is the battlecruiser's reactor core is significantly compromised, causing various fires, explosions, radiation leaks, and nuclear fusion spikes to spread out onto the vessel.  Work is already in progress to learn from these engineering hacks in order to make the next battlecruiser class use this ability standard without hull integrity loss..
Button/Tooltip/Overlord=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Provides supply. Supply allows you to create more units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Gargantis Proximae</c><n/><n/>The semi-intelligent, space-faring behemoths known as the Gargantis Proximae were inducted into the Swarm so that their heightened senses could benefit Zerg warriors in battle. The Gargantis flyers were assimilated into the Swarm so well that the Cerebrates use them to maintain control over their forces. Overlords keep the warriors of the swarm ordered and coordinated during battle, and with their enhanced senses they often serve as advanced scouts. They have the innate ability to sense any hidden enemy units, including those under the effects of cloaking systems or distortion fields.<n/><n/>In addition to commanding troops against their enemies, the Overlords also have the responsibility of transporting Zerg warriors within the hollows of their reinforced carapace hides. Only larger Zerg nests seem to have this particular breed of Overlord, but it is generally a good idea to kill these creatures on sight for safety’s sake.
Button/Tooltip/Overmind=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The collective sentience of the Zerg Swarm.</c><n/><n/>Created several millennia ago by the enigmatic Xel’Naga, the Overmind represents the collective consciousness of the Zerg race. Believing that it exists to become the perfect life-form by assimilating the strongest species in the universe, the Overmind is obsessed with its sacred mission. Brilliant and cunning in the extreme, the Overmind will stop at nothing to ensure its success.<n/><n/>The Overmind has the deepest respect for the Protoss, whom it believes to be the greatest species it has sought to conquer. The inevitable conflict with the Protoss will be its ultimate test.
Button/Tooltip/Overmind2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Cerebrates are among the few Zerg with a unique personality. They relay the Overmind's will, commanding their Broods and directing minions in battle.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Original Zerg Strain</c><n/><n/>Cerebrates were descended from the original Zerg parasites of Zerus that existed before the coming of the Xel'Naga, albeit being much larger and endowed with much greater intelligence. Upon their creation by the Overmind, each Cerebrate and the Brood it led was given a specific role which in turn shaped the Cerebrate's personality. Cerebrates also oversaw the evolution of the Swarm.<n/><n/>Cerebrates further expanded the Zerg hierarchy and came to rely on Queens to oversee hive activity and Overlords to relay commands to and directly control the Brood's minions. While the rigid hierarchy ensured efficiency, the permanent death of a Cerebrate could induce a complete reversal. Broods that lost their Cerebrate frequently became uncontrollably destructive. <n/><n/>Externally, Cerebrates appeared as giant, bloated slug-larvae with numerous purple limbs protruding from the sides.
Button/Tooltip/Parasite=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Attaches a tiny parasite to another unit, allowing the player to see whatever the affected unit sees.</c><n/><n/>By attaching a tiny, remora-like parasite to another unit, the Queen can allow the Overmind to see through the eyes of the enemy. The parasite is not readily visible and once detected can only be removed by killing its host.
Button/Tooltip/PerditionTurret=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Automated defensive turret. Burrows when there are no enemies nearby.

Their weapons come from scavenged flamethrowers and have slowly been gaining a permanent place in terran arsenals although most squadrons have yet to see approval for their construction outside of top secret military installations.  The turret's weapon fires a deadly wall of flame that is ideal for holding off large waves of enemy units. The turret also conceals itself beneath the ground when out of combat, luring unsuspecting enemies into its field of fire.

Button/Tooltip/PermanentlyCloakedZeratul=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Experience Needed: 0.  Next Level: 50<n/><n/>+ Nerazim Cloaking<n/></c><n/>Nerazim warriors, or Dark Templar as they are more commonly known, have undergone centuries of discipline and training.  Zeratul is no exception to this fact as he is one of the oldest Nerazim, second only to the great matriarch Raszagal herself, to have witnessed and harbored the infinite knowledge of the void.  Although age has slowed down this great warrior, as Zeratul trains in hand to hand combat he will remaster his abilities to harness the true power of the void once again and unleash it upon his foes.<n/><n/>Few possess a limited number of technologies that are capable of dealing with these warriors.  Even fewer can take on Zeratul himself, save perhaps, the Queen of Blades...
Button/Tooltip/PermanentlyCloakedZeratul2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Artifacts Needed: 3.  Next Level: 6<n/><n/>- Zeratul is permanently cloaked<n/>- 20% evasion from attacks<n/></c><n/>Contrary to popular belief, dark templar did not learn how to hide themselves from their time spent apart from Aiur in the depths of the Void.  In fact, the Nerazim were originally taught this skill to hide from the Conclave by the legendary templar Adun, who led the dark templar himself before they were exiled in fear from Aiur.<n/><n/>This ability has been described as "bending light" and "merging with shadows" and can be accomplished quite effortlessly with little to no energy used once mastered.  It allows its wielder to become invisible to all but the most accurate of detectors.   Additional mastery of this ability allows its user to create shadows of itself, even while detected, to dodge incoming attacks as well as improving regeneration when out of combat and back into the shadows.

Button/Tooltip/PhotonCannon=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Primary defensive structure. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c><n/><n/>The Protoss revel in the glory of personal combat, but they also recognise the need for automated defenses to watch over their colonies. Photon Cannons are enhanced with special sensor technology borrowed from the tiny Observer, enabling them to detect cloaked and hidden units.<n/><n/>As with all Protoss buildings, care should be taken to provide ample Pylon support for Cannons. Should their link to the Psionic Matrix be broken, they will shut down — thus leaving the way open to the enemies of Aiur.

Button/Tooltip/PickupPlasmaRounds=Refined Palladium used for experimental armor.  Pickup with the Commander to collect.
Button/Tooltip/Plague=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">A highly toxic cloud which severely damages units and structures caught in it. Will not kill affected targets, leaving their health at 1. Bypasses Protoss shields.</c><n/><n/>With this ability, the Defiler produces a batch of corrosive spores that it then explosively projects in a dense cloud around its enemies. This highly toxic cloud corrodes anything caught within its midst.
Button/Tooltip/PlasmaShield=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Grants a targeted Protoss ally +100 shields for 6 seconds.  Shields are regenerated rapidly within the duration.</c><n/><n/>Calling forth energy from his own psionics as well as from the Void itself, Tassadar can bolster not only his own shield capacitors but any other Protoss unit or vessel.  This can greatly increase survivability for Tassadar and his allies but the effect can only be sustained briefly.
Button/Tooltip/PointDefenseDrone=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Automated defensive turret. Times out after <d ref="Behavior,AutoTurretTimedLife,Duration"/> seconds.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Auto turrets have long been used in defending Confederate installations from mercenaries and fringe colonists looking for a quick payday with great success.  However, they were ill suited to defend against the Sons of Korhal and the Zerg.  When the Dominion took hold of this technology they realized instead of re-deploying this, they could miniturize an auto turret to be manufactured aboard the Magellan.  In mid-flight, the cybernetic construct can rapidly launch an auto-turret projectile at an area where it quickly deploys and provides light resistance, or if anything, a distraction against incoming enemies.
Button/Tooltip/Predator=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Anti-infantry specialist that deals area damage with each attack.  Can attack ground units.</c></c><n/><n/>An experimental robotic technology utilizing the latest in weapons designs, Predators, sometimes called "cybercats", are big, heavy robots shaped like cats.   Predators were used in service of the Terran Dominion, but only as special opsí reconnaissance. Schezarís research into how Protoss can utilize nearby electrical fields have given a new theory in Dominion research into using their own electrical fields to discharge waves of energy against ground enemies with devastating results.  Only a handful of these weapons exist.  
Button/Tooltip/PrimalHeal=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Heals Kerrigan for <d ref="Effect,PrimalHealBig,VitalArray[0].Change"/> life and friendly biological units nearby for <d ref="Effect,PrimalHealSmall,VitalArray[0].Change"/> life. An additional 50% of the amount healed regenerates over <d time="15"/>.</c><n/><n/>Utilizing her own psionic prowess, Kerrigan can modify the most basic zerg genetic trait of self regeneration to rapidly replace dead or damaged cells and tissue at the genetic level.  In theory, by concentrating hard enough, she can even recover lost limbs at will.<n/><n/>By psionically twisting zerg essence, Kerrigan is able to not only heal herself but her own minions as the effect is so powerful that it spills onto those nearby who bask in her power.  While temporary and cannot be sustained forever, this can still mean the difference between life and death in critical situations.
Button/Tooltip/PrimalSlash=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Kerrigan leaps to her target from a distance of <d ref="Abil,PrimalSlash,Range[0]"/> and deals <d ref="Effect,PrimalSlash,Amount"/> damage. Can also be used to travel to a target location quickly.</c><n/><n/>Within her new evolved form, Kerrigan is able to leap far into the air and land upon a target enemy, impaling them with her sharp claws.  This usually deals mortal damage to the target enemy if a direct hit is landed, otherwise, this places Kerrigan in a tactical position for direct attacks.<n/><n/>In addition, while Kerrigan cannot use her long claw arms to achieve flight, she can use this ability to travel quickly to a nearby locations that would otherwise be impossible to get to.
Button/Tooltip/Probe=<c val="ffff8a">Basic worker unit. Can gather resources and warp in Protoss structures. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Particle Beam</c><n/><n/>Probes are robotic drones that service the Nexus and gather the numerous resources needed to power Protoss technologies. Probes also manufacture and plant the micro-beacons that anchor the teleport matrices of Protoss structures. These beacons allow the Protoss to warp in prefabricated buildings from their Homeworld.
Button/Tooltip/PrologueVoidArmor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Artifacts Needed: 0.  Next Level: 3<n/><n/>- Grants nearby friendly units +100 shields for 10 seconds.</c><n/><n/>Using his own psionic essence, Zeratul can call forth energy from the void to bolster not only his own shield capacitors but those around him.  This can greatly increase survivability for Zeratul and his allies but the effect can only be sustained briefly.
Button/Tooltip/ProtossArtifact=Ancient Protoss artifact containing useful technology.  Pickup with Zeratul.
Button/Tooltip/ProtossRelic=Ancient Protoss Relic. Strong psionics are emantating within.  Pickup with Kerrigan.
Button/Tooltip/ProtossTemple=<c val="ffff8a">An ancient Xel'Naga temple, older than the Zerg themselves.  Built on the spot where the Xel'Naga first set foot on Aiur.  It must be destroyed so the Overmind can manifest itself physically on Aiur.</c><n/><n/>When the Xel'Naga first set foot upon Aiur and begun the process of uplifting its native sentient race, the Protoss, they marked their arrival by commanding the Protoss to construct a temple to their designs.  Although the Xel'Naga had constructed various temples across multiple worlds before Aiur, this particular temple was different.  While previous temples had specific functions, this structure was inert.  When the Xel'Naga abandoned their experiments with the Protoss and civil war plunged the world into chaos, many tribes took refuge within its inner chambers.  Some claimed to have discovered secret passages that led to vast underground deposits of the sacred crystal known as Khaydarin.  Why the Xel'Naga would need to store huge quantities of the psi-attuned crystal, remains unknown to this day.<n/><n/>The term "temple" is a misnomer, as there is nothing to suggest any form of worship took place in them.  However, the name has stuck.  Recently across the Koprulu sector, a number of temples have begun unearthing themselves, drawing the attention of terran archaeologists.  Many have begun petitioning the new Dominion government to charter expeditions to unearth them in order to learn their secrets.
Button/Tooltip/PsiDisruptor=<c val="ffff8a">A Terran device used to hamper zerg communications and movement.  Can be used across vast distances and reach hundreds of worlds when at full power.</c><n/><n/>When the Zerg first invaded civilian colonies, the Terran Confederacy had manufactured a number of portable machines called Psi Emitters which had the uncanny ability to lure Zerg to their signals. The Confederacy had hoped to use the devices to redirect the Zerg movements away from their holdings, but many had already been destroyed or stolen by the Sons of Korhal.  In response, the Confederacy attempted one final effort to halt the Zerg progress by constructing a specialized emitter that could disrupt the Zerg's communications.  This "psi disrupter" was completed during the Zerg's invasion of Tarsonis, but for reasons unknown, the never activated it.  Newly crowned Emperor Mengsk had heard the rumors about the device, and sent teams back to Tarsonis to recover it, but was never able find it and deemed the device lost.  <n/><n/>Upon the invasion of the Koprulu sector by the United Earth Directorate Expeditionary Force, a number of research teams were secretly deployed to find anything of value that could be used to overthrow Mengsk and enslave the Zerg.  Upon one such team landing on the ruined former Confederate capital world of Tarsonis, they uncovered what they believed to be a hidden weapons relay.  Lieutenant Samir Duran instead explained the true nature of the device according to rumors he had heard.  Duran was quick to suggest that the Disrupter be destroyed as quickly as possible, citing if the Dominion learned of its location and purpose, it could put the UED's ultimate goal in jeopardy.
Button/Tooltip/PsiStorm=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Creates a storm of psionic energy that lasts 4 seconds, causing up to 112 damage to all units in the target area.</c><n/><n/>One of the first lessons of the Khala is how to close one’s mind to the outside world. The Protoss are such powerful psychics that they can inadvertently send out psychic “ripples” that are disruptive to other life forms. With careful training, High Templar learn to focus these ripples into a storm of raw psychic energy that is capable of literally tearing apart the minds of lesser species.
Button/Tooltip/PsionicLift=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Enemies in target area are stunned for <d ref="Behavior,PsionicLift,Duration"/> seconds and take <d ref="Behavior,PsionicLift,Duration * Effect,PsionicLiftDamage,Amount"/> damage over time.</c><n/><n/>By focusing her psionic energy onto a targeted large area, the Queen of Blades can forcibly lift enemy foes from an area and use the energy to hold them with crushing force.  The effect is so strong it can be used to maintain an entire attacking force in place while damaging them in the process.  Even if the energy itself doesn't get the job done, while the enemy is caught in its field the queen's zerg can rip them to shreds.
Button/Tooltip/Pylon=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Provides supply. Supply allows you to warp in more units. Creates power for nearby structures.</c><n/><n/>Carved from the sacred Khaydarin Crystals found only on the Protoss Homeworld, Pylons act as focal points for the Psionic Matrix emitted by the Nexus. The floating Pylons can power any Protoss buildings within a large radius around them, and establishing a network of Pylons is essential to properly expanding a new Protoss colony.
Button/Tooltip/QueenClassic=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Specialist unit. Can use Ensnare, Spawn Broodling, and Parasite.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Arachnis Brood-Keeper</c><n/><n/>The Zerg Queen does not produce larvae, as her name might suggest, but she has earned her royal status from her ability to spawn numerous other parasitic creatures. The Queen can also attack by expelling a voracious symbiote that rapidly slices its way through opposing forces. Since her lightly armored body leaves her vulnerable to attack, the Queen usually stays near the central hive to watch over maturing Zerg.
Button/Tooltip/QueenPassive=Queen's Nest allows you to morph Queens.
Button/Tooltip/RapidRegeneration=Applies spores that reduce armor by 1 and attack speed by 12%. Stacks up to 9 times.
Button/Tooltip/Raszagal=<c val="ffff8a">Matriarch of the Dark Templar. She is one of the most powerful psychics in the galaxy and is renowned for her stoicism and calmness.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Psi Assault</c><n/><n/>Raszagal was a young member of the Rogue Tribes, a secret protoss movement on Aiur which disdained the Khala, the innate protoss psionic bond. Raszagal herself was captured by Conclave agents and held prisoner where she was treated poorly.  The Conclave ordered the new Templar executor, Adun, to execute Raszagal and other Rogues as they feared their views could create another Aeon of Strife. Adun interrogated Raszagal, but felt her views were reasonable, and couldn't bring himself to execute her. Instead, he hid her and the other Rogues, faking their executions. Adun felt the Conclave would soon learn the truth of his ruse and began teaching them how to hide from the Conclave. Raszagal learned this new power most quickly, but all the Rogues learned faster than even Adun could teach them. Unfortunately, this caused psionic storms to spiral out of control, alerting the Conclave to the deception.<n/><n/>The Conclave decided to banish the wayward Rogues from Aiur forever. The Templar under Adun were sworn to silence as the Rogues were loaded onto an ancient, but functional xel'naga ship. However, Adun's presence prompted the Khalai to attack him.  Fearing the stress of the attacks could spark more uncontrolled psionic storms, Adun took drastic measures to end the combat. The Rogues escaped as Adun protected them with a brilliant array of light and dark energies.  He became consumed by the energy.<n/><n/>Around the Terran year 2000, Raszagal became leader of the Dark Templar tribes on Shakuras. By 2500 and at 1,045 years of age, she was one of the oldest living protoss, and of the Dark Templar.  Raszagal remained one of the few Dark Templar old enough to clearly remember Aiur from before their exile. However, as Raszagal aged, her control over her powers began to slip.
Button/Tooltip/RaszagalStun=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Imprisons a single ground or air enemy in psionic energy, stunning it and suppressing its ability to detect for 6 seconds.</c></c><n/><n/>By focusing from within, Raszagal can summon the void to imprison an enemy unit within a space-time cocoon like shell.   To the helpless victim trapped within, time moves rapidly for a brief moment, but to the outside observer, the unit appears to be slowed down to a near standstill.  This leaves the affected victim helpless to outside forces which can effortlessly pass this cocoon barrier to inflict damage without fear of retaliation.
Button/Tooltip/Ravager=<c val="ffff8a">Ranged artillery. Can use Corrosive Bile.Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Zantar Slug</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Plasma Discharge</c><n/><n/>Since the incorporate of the Roach into the Zerg Swarm, evolution master Abathur has continued to twist and fine tune the genome this near perfect creation, yet nothing fruitful has come forth.  A breakthrough came when rapid xel'naga energy was introduced, causing a brief, but useful catalyst for evolution.  The result is a Ravager which has evolved the Roach far beyond its biological limitations.  Ravagers stand almost four times as tall as a terran wearing CMC armor, and hardened bone spikes portrude from its back. Its eyes grant it a broad spectrum of vision.<n/><n/>The ravager wields plasma fire both in close-quarters combat and as a wedge to crack open entrenched positions, something the Swarm has struggled with in the past.  As an evolution of the roach, the ravager has developed a larger, heavier frame to store quantities of fiery fluid in its back. The ravager can launch a gob of corrosive bile from its back in a parabolic arc. This projectile is slow, best used against stationary targets, but can destroy protoss force fields, and is effective against heavy units and structures.  While this evolution to the Roach will not be sustainable in newer generations, Abathur has already begun work on how to naturally evolve Roaches to this new strain overtime.
Button/Tooltip/Raven=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Aerial support unit. Can use Auto-Turret, Point Defense Drone, and be upgraded to use Seeker Missile.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Seeker missle</c><n/><n/>Based off the early Dominion designs of the TF-620 Nomad, the Raven is controlled remotely by a Terran pilot while the craft's computer houses the main AI core that regulates all critical ship systems and sub-systems.  Ravens excel in protection and reconnaissance due to their defensive auto-turrets and their advanced sensors, which can detect cloaked or burrowed enemies. The craft is equipped with an advanced manufacturing plant, where hundreds of thousands of AI-operated nanomachines diligently assemble a diversity of mission critical equipment, such as the auto-turret, point defense drone, and the seeker missile.<n/><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c>
Button/Tooltip/RawSolarite=Solarite in its purest form. Can be used to increase a user's psionics.  Stewart can collect this for Kerrigan's use later.

After his time in the Confederate Marine Corps and subsequent life as an outlaw, Raynor spent many years keeping the peace on the colony of Mar Sara. As Confederate enforcements became increasingly harsh, Raynor decided to join up with the Sons of Korhal.<n/><n/>Although he is new to the movement, Raynor has proven himself to be a dynamic leader and he is well liked and respected by the troops under his command. Despite his often sarcastic demeanour, Jim is fiercely loyal to the Sons of Korhal and will put it all on the line without hesitation.
Button/Tooltip/RaynorSpiderMine=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Spider Mines pursue enemy units that come in range, and detonate for heavy area damage. Buried Spider Mines can only be seen by enemy <c val="FFE303">Detectors</c>.</c><n/><n/>Spider mines were developed on Earth, and are one of the few technologies to survive the Long Sleep. Mines were deployed during the Guild Wars. One of the most proficient users was Victor Kachinsky, who became a Kel-Morian war hero as a result. Equipping vultures with spider mines became more popular in the late 2490's, especially on border worlds.  A spider mine burrows into the ground when deployed. When a target enters the range of its motion sensors, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>In 2499, Jaunt Pictures published the holomovie, Spider Mines IV: Death from Below, about sentient mines that turned against their creators. It was the last in the series.
Button/Tooltip/RaynorSpiderMines=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Spider Mines pursue enemy units that come in range, and detonate for heavy area damage. Buried Spider Mines can only be seen by enemy <c val="FFE303">Detectors</c>.<n/><n/>Raynor's mines utilize a 10 second cooldown after placement.  Up to 3 mines can be placed at any given time.</c><n/><n/>Spider mines were developed on Earth, and are one of the few technologies to survive the Long Sleep. Mines were deployed during the Guild Wars. One of the most proficient users was Victor Kachinsky, who became a Kel-Morian war hero as a result. Equipping vultures with spider mines became more popular in the late 2490's, especially on border worlds.  A spider mine burrows into the ground when deployed. When a target enters the range of its motion sensors, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>Marshall James Raynor had his personal vulture outfitted with micro-processors which can quickly construct a new mine after the old one has been placed.
Button/Tooltip/RazorSwarm=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Summons a powerful psionic storm that deals <d ref="Effect,OmegaStormDamage,Amount"/> base damage to units and a bonus <d ref="Effect,OmegaStormDamage,AttributeBonus[Structure]"/> damage to structures periodically over a <d ref="Effect,OmegaStormSearchArea,AreaArray[0].Radius" precision="2"/> radius.</c><n/><n/>Kerrigan can concentrate enough psionic energy to summon a deadly psionic storm in an area that damages everything in its area over a period of time. While resembling a similar ability used from Protoss High Templar, this power has grown far beyond that which they can achieve and can literally break down structures as well as that of individual units.
Button/Tooltip/Reaver=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Heavy artillery. Manufactures and fires Scarab Drones with a large blast radius. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Scarab Drones</c><n/><n/>Automatons used primarily for ground support, the massive, mechanical Reavers are renowned for their ability to level entire colonies in moments. The Reaver itself does not mount any weaponry, but instead houses a micro-manufacturing plant similar to the Protoss Carrier.
Button/Tooltip/ReaverHoldFire=Orders selected reavers to close their scarab launch bay and avoid engaging enemies, unless given a direct command. Units holding fire will flee if attacked.
Button/Tooltip/ReaverWeaponsFree=Orders selected reavers to fire at will. They will engage enemy units within range.

Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Eviscerator Rail Gun</c><n/><n/>The first diamondback prototypes were produced by the Terran Confederacy during the Great War, but never developed beyond that stage.  After the fall of the Confederacy, Omega Squadron retained a few remaining models that were not lost on Tarsonis.  Diamondbacks are fast, high-damage hovertanks. Rail Gun can fire while the Diamondback is moving.<n/><n/>The Red Adder model was originally deployed to Halcyon to defend against mercenary attacks.  It boasts increased durability, speed, and weapon damage.
Button/Tooltip/Refinery=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Built over a Vespene Geyser to allow harvesting of vespene gas.</c><n/><n/>The rather ramshackle Refineries were designed to speed up the arduous process of Vespene mining on the more desolate Terran worlds. Once constructed on top of a Vespene geyser, the Refinery will automatically package the gas into containers easily transportable by SCVs.
Button/Tooltip/RegenerativeBioSteel=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Automatically repairs the Warbringer when out of combat at a rate of <d ref="Behavior,RegenerativeBioSteelSiegeTank,Modification.VitalRegenArray[Life]"/> life per second.</c><n/><n/>Using the internal scarab production within the Warbringer, extra scarab components are able to rapidly repair any hull damage the massive Reaver might endure, allowing it incredible durability in the field of battle.

Button/Tooltip/ResearchBattlecruiserSpecializations=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Battlecruiser ability. Fires a concentrated nuclear blast at a targeted unit, causing 260 damage.</c><n/><n/>Recent research has led to the development of the devastating Yamato Cannon, a terrifying weapon that uses an intense magnetic field to focus a small nuclear explosion into a cohesive beam of energy. The Cannon requires a huge energy reserve to fire, but its effects are impressive, to say the least.<n/><n/>Terran engineers are currently working overtime to retrofit existing Battlecruisers with Yamato devices, but many older ships are still in service.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchBurrow=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Enables most Zerg ground units to use the Burrow ability. Burrow allows a unit to take cover underground, rendering it unable to attack (except for Lurkers). A burrowed unit is invisible unless revealed by detectors or effects.</c><n/><n/>Excepting the massive Ultralisk, all Zerg creatures that inhabit the ground may gain the ability to bury themselves beneath any surface.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchCharge=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the movement speed of Zealots.</c><n/><n/>Zealot power suits can be enhanced with cybernetic boosters that enable these warriors to close on their victims with frightening speed.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchCombatShield=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Commander has a 50% chance to block incoming ranged attacks.  Will not block any melee or spell damage.<n/></c><n/>The LarsCorp Technologies M98 ballistic alloy combat shield is a prototype for a terran personal protective device. The shield is made of 30mm of bonded carbide, shown to increase marine survivability by 25%.<n/><n/>Through the black market, the Commander is able to purchase this prototype in order to defend against incoming attacks.  A standard marine would simply use the shield as an extra plate of armor but the Commander can expertly wield it to actually deflect against incoming projectiles quite effectively, shrugging off otherwise deadly attacks.  However, the shield provides little cover against the claws of a zergling or the blades of a zealot.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchConsume=Defiler ability. Feeds on and kills a friendly Zerg unit, replenishing 50 energy.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchDisruptionWeb=Corsair ability. Creates a net of energy at the target area that prevents all units and structures underneath from attacking.

Button/Tooltip/ResearchHighTemplarEnergyUpgrade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the maximum energy of High Templar by 50 and starting energy by 12.5.</c><n/><n/>By equipping themselves with amulets carved from Khaydarin crystal, the High Templar are able to channel the energies of the Khala with greater efficiency.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchImprovedFlashbangGrenade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Palladium Needed: 3<n/>Iridium Needed: 3<n/><n/>The Commander's flashbang grenade has its stun duration increased by 2 and area of effect increased by 66%. <n/></c><n/>Advances in both deploying new grenades faster in the field as well as compartmentalizing its components to allow for greater effect have allowed the flashbang grenade to control the battlefield to an impressive effect.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchImprovedHellfireBlast=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Palladium Needed: 15<n/>Iridium Needed: 14<n/><n/>The Commander's ability Hellfire Blast has its base damaged increased to 200.  Mechanical and Structure targets will take an additional 200 damage. Upgrades the max charges held to 7.<n/></c><n/>Augmenting the Hellfire Blast using a questionable, yet highly effective, overcharge technique has enabled the temperature output to allow the output blast with enough force to melt the hull off most armored units and reinforced structures.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchImprovedPulseGrenade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Palladium Needed: 8<n/>Iridium Needed: 10<n/><n/>The Commander's ability Pulse Grenade has its base damaged increased to 100.  Biological and Psionic targets will now take an additional 100 damage. Self-damage also increased to 100.<n/></c><n/>Working with several Protoss artifacts found, human scientists have managed to upgrade the Commander's Pulse Grenade by adding several psi matrix fields that explode upon impact, further devastating ground units.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchIonThrusters=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the movement speed of Vultures.</c><n/><n/>Originally designed for inner-atmosphere shuttles, these engines have been modified to provide increased speed for the Vulture Hover Cycle.

Button/Tooltip/ResearchLazarusProtocol=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Palladium Needed: 21<n/>Iridium Needed: 22<n/><n/>Upon receiving near fatal damage, the Commander automatically becomes incapacitated for 20 seconds while recovering health to 100%.  Can only be activated once every 5 minutes.</c><n/><n/>Utilizing the latest in black market special research, brilliant yet paranoid fringe scientists have created what they dub the Lazarus Protocol.  Installed onboard a marine combat suit with liquified rare materials, the protocol detects when health is near critical levels and immediately the suit automatically powers down, feigning death.  The suit then delivers a highly experimental and controversial set of drugs that brings the occupant to near death before rapidly regenerating any tissue damage done thus far.<n/><n/>Dominion scientists are aware of such drugs but have deemed them unsafe for standard marine use due to the occasional miscalculation of drugs used which instead outright kill the marine occupant instead of saving their life.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchLockdown=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Ghost ability. Temporarily disables a targeted mechanical or robotic unit.</c><n/><n/>Designed for the Ghost C-10 Canister Rifle, Lockdown ammo temporarily disables mechanised units caught within their blast.

Button/Tooltip/ResearchNeosteelPlating=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the armor of most structures by 2.</c> <n/><n/>Neosteel is an exceptionally durable material utilized by terrans. Found on every modern mechanical craft such as the plating on Battlecruisers to the lining on Goliaths, neosteel requires catalytic elements to create. The richest source was New Folsom, but the much safer Sara system is used for the same purpose.  <n/><n/>Recent Dominion research into improving neosteel construction processes has leaked onto the black market, allowing the highest bidder to retrofit existing structure frames with improved plating, able to withstand even the strongest of blasts.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchOcularImplants=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases Ghost sight range.</c><n/><n/>In an effort to improve their effectiveness as covert operatives, Ghost agents can undergo radical surgery to replace their eyes with these sight-range enhancing cybernetic devices.

Button/Tooltip/ResearchSiegeTech=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Siege Tank ability. While in Siege Mode, Siege Tanks have significantly increased range and damage, but they cannot move or attack units at close range.</c><n/><n/>This technology retrofits the Arclite Siege Tank to transform into a stationary artillery piece capable of delivering increased damage at a longer range.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchSingularityCharge=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the attack range of Dragoons.</c><n/><n/>By employing technology that restructures antiparticle amplitudes, the Dragoon Phase Disruptor range is extended.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchSpiderMinesSC1=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Vulture ability. Spider Mines burrow into the ground and cannot be spotted without a detector or effect. When enemy ground units pass nearby, the Spider Mine will unburrow, chase down the units, and detonate.</c><n/><n/>Vultures can be equipped with small, motion-detecting mines that bury themselves once deployed. These mines automatically track nearby targets.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchStasis=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Arbiter ability. Projects a field which holds units immobile, preventing them from moving, attacking, being attacked, or using abilities.</c><n/><n/>By manipulating space-time fields, the Arbiter can place units in a state of Stasis. While the affected unit cannot move, it is also unaffected in any way by other units.
Button/Tooltip/ResearchWraithEnergyUpgrade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the maximum energy of Wraiths by 50 and starting energy by 12.5.</c><n/><n/>These high-yield uranium reactors permit the Wraith fighter to remain cloaked for longer periods of time.
Button/Tooltip/RoachVile=<c val="ffff8a">Assault unit. Regenerates life quickly while burrowed. Can slow and poison the enemy.<n/><n/><c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Can attack ground units.</c></c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Zantar Slug</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Acid Saliva</c><n/><n/>The roach is a particularly tough, armored breed which possesses a high-speed regeneration ability when burrowed. Roaches evolved from the fast-healing zantar slug of Garrxax and in use by 2501, taking part in a battle on Shi. Their ranged acid saliva attack is capable of penetrating neosteel and armor, and violently dissolving flesh on multiple entry points. This saliva is derived from the zantar slug and is expelled with considerable force through the muscles that surround the roach's salivary glands--highly specialized striated ducts that produce a unique enzyme that weaponizes the creature's already corrosive saliva.<n/><n/>Zagara is able to spawn her own unique eggs with small genetic variations.  These particular roaches are born with the ability to infect its victim with an acidic poison that deals damage overtime as well as causing it to move more slowly.
Button/Tooltip/RoboticsBay=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for the Shuttle and Reaver.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Reavers</c><n/><n/>This secondary buildings is intended to bolster the capabilities of the Robotics Facility.

Button/Tooltip/RoboticsFacility=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Warps in Protoss robotic units.<n/><n/></c>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Shuttles</c><n/><n/>The Protoss rely on automated war machines to bolster their numbers and avoid the loss of Protoss life. While the Robotics Facility manufactures these vehicles, other buildings are required to expand its capabilities.
Button/Tooltip/SC1PsiEmitter=<c val="FFFF8A">Classified technology that lures the Zerg to its location.</c><n/><n/>The Transplanar Psionic Waveform Emitter, also known as a psi-emitter, was first constructed by the Terran Confederate Research Division during the first sightings of the Zerg.  Psi emitters are portable machines have the uncanny ability to lure zerg to their signals. Those running the Confederate Ghost Program found that the zerg are attuned to the psychic emanations of ghosts. The emitters broadcast the neural imprint of a ghost, but at a much greater magnitude.  Requiring a ghost or other psychic to be activated, they can reach across worlds, having a maximum range of around 10-25 light years. Numerous psi emitters in the same area appear to amplify the overall effect. Psi-emitters can be attuned to attract particular zerg breeds to a location.<n/><n/>The Terran Confederacy intended to use psi-emitters to lure the zerg into isolated containment areas. Their plan was to use the zerg to put an end to their other rivals and be lauded as heroes for coming in and destroying the zerg.  However, when activated, these emitters brought the entire Swarm to the Koprulu Sector rather than the manageable numbers the Confederacy had hoped for.  One such emitter, present on Mar Sara, was acquired by Sons of Korhal engineer Merdith Jernic. She was captured by the 417th Confederate Marine Platoon, which had been abandoned by the Confederacy, and questioned by its commander, Lieutenant L. Z. Breanne. Breanne was suspicious of Jernic's story of how she acquired the device (claiming the Sons of Korhal brought it to her), and Breanne accused her of activating it. Jernic suggested letting the zerg attack the cities, while the platoon would escape with the Sons of Korhal and the emitter. She claimed the atrocities of the Confederacy forced the rebels to use the device "against further Confederate aggression". The platoon eventually activated the emitter in order to lure the zerg towards their prepared position and away from the major cities long enough for the Sons of Korhal to evacuate the citizens of Mar Sara City. The platoon was wiped out.
Button/Tooltip/SCV=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Basic worker unit. Can gather resources, build Terran structures, and repair. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Fusion Cutters</c><n/><n/>Initially used during the reconstruction of the Tarsonian Orbital Platforms, the T-280 SCV (Space Construction Vehicle) became a staple in intra-Colonial construction and engineering due to its ability to perform a multitude of tasks, including the construction of new buildings and the transportation of raw resource materials. It is this versatility, and an unmatched reliability, that make the SCV an invaluable tool in rapidly establishing Marine encampments and strike bases on any terrain.

When using his powerful warp blades, Zeratul can actually manifest into existence a psionic aura that allows him to strike at all foes around him with lightning precision.  However, Zeratul and Tassadar are not the first protoss to learn the secrets of merging psionics with the void.  The first was Adun.<n/><n/>Adun was a powerful protoss warrior who led the Templar on Aiur shortly before the exile of the Dark Templar. While the Khalai revered him as a hero due to the stories passed on from the Conclave about his heroic efforts in sacrificing himself in order to weed out the dark templar "taint", the truth has been hidden behind lies.  In reality, Adun refused to carry out the Conclaves order of executing the "rogues" on Aiur.  He in fact protected them to the end by creating a shield of psionic and void energies until it caused him to burn out like a star.  Today, Adun's true legend among the Nerazim is passed down through each generation.

During armed conflicts, scanner sweeps are often used to track enemy movement.
Button/Tooltip/SchezarArmor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Schezar will regenerate his life slowly if he has not recently taken damage.</c><n/><n/>One of the first modifications Schezar bought from fringe world engineers was the proto-Selfix type steel for his goliath mec.  Using nano-technology Schezar's goliath is able to rapidly patch holes and make vehicle repairs periodically, as long as he hasn't taken any attacks to damage the integrity of the goliath recently.  The armor is extremely rare as only one set made it out intact before the plant was destroyed by the Dominion.  It will take decades before similar nano technology can be developed for use in regular combat.
Button/Tooltip/ScienceFacility=<c val="ffff8a">Hi-tech research facility. Allows more advanced units and upgrades.</c> <n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Science Vessels</c><n/><n/>Terran researchers work with forced diligence at the Science Facility to develop radical new weapons and defensive systems.

Button/Tooltip/ScienceVessel=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Aerial support unit. Can use Irradiate, Defensive Matrix and EMP Shockwave.</c><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c><n/><n/>Many Colonies have placed Explorer Vessels at strategic points throughout the galaxy to further study anomalous phenomena, and the Corps’ own Epsilon Squadron uses them extensively along Confederate borders for surveillance and study.<n/><n/>Recently, as alien forces have begun to infringe upon Colonial space, Explorer Vessels and crew have been recalled to provide electronic warfare and combat support. The primary ability of the Explorer is detecting concealed enemy units. By outfitting the Explorer with special modifications, several other useful effects can be created.

Can also rapidly self-repair at will.</c><n/><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c><n/><n/>Commodore Magellan is an advanced Dominion cybernetic construct AI stolen from Confederacy designs during the rise of the Terran Dominion.  Magellan was originally intended to become a new form of Terran Adjutant, however Magellan's impressive AI intelligence rendered it invaluable as a top Dominion scientist.  Originally chosen to test pilot a support craft - the TF-620 Nomad classification "Raven", it was instead assigned it's own unique science vessel.<n/><n/>The modified craft can utilize standard Science Vessel abilities but at a fraction of the energy cost due to a unique energy core design.  Furthermore, using nano-welder parts from a TF-620, Magellan can perform a self-hull repair in mid flight using hundreds of tiny robotic bots.  More research is being performed if these nano-welders can produce other helpful abilities and if the "Raven" is a more suitable vessel for such things.
Button/Tooltip/ScientistUED=As the the government that would become the UED took control of most the Earth, it launched a massive campaign of "racial purification" against those who had developed minor mutations or replaced part of their body with mechanical implants. Millions died, until a high-profile UPL scientist, Doran Routhe, decided to use the expendable prisoners to found colonies beyond the Solar System.<n/><n/>Four supercarriers were sent to a nearby star system, but a computer malfunction deleted the coordinates. The supercarriers flew past their intended destination into outer space. The AI that controlled the supercarriers kept performing analysis on the prisoners' DNA, and realized that a few generations of interbreeding might suffice for the colonists to develop psionic capabilities. Ghosts are the finest example of these human psychics. <n/><n/>After twenty-eight years of warp travel, vital supplies ran low and emergency protocols took over. The supercarriers crash-landed on planets that would be known as Tarsonis, Moria and Umoja - the first Terran colonies.

Can attack air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorLightGrey">unknown</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Plasma metamorphosis</c><n/><n/>In stark contrast to the lumbering Guardian is the tiny Scourge. These blind terrors seek out enemy starships and dive into them. Catalytic agents found within the body of the Scourge cause it to explode like a living plasma bomb when it smashes itself against the hull of a larger vessel.<n/><n/>Large numbers of these creatures can cripple a squad of fighters or even a Battlecruiser. Like the Zergling, the simplistic genetic makeup of the Scourge allows two of them to hatch from a single egg.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Dual Photon Blasters<n/>Anti-Matter Missiles</c><n/><n/>Only 262 years old, Artanis was appointed to the position of Executor at a young age during the Zerg invasion of Aiur, following the apparent defection of the previous Executor, Tassadar. Artanis fought the Zerg alongside his old comrade, Fenix, and earned the title of Praetor soon after the death of the Overmind.<n/><n/>Artanis harbors a deep respect and admiration for Tassadar. He hopes to become as great a leader as Tassadar; a path which, although noble, could cause him to forsake his better judgement.
Button/Tooltip/ScoutSpeedBoost=Increases Artanis' movement speed by 100% for <d time="10"/>.
Button/Tooltip/Selendis=Capital ship. Can build and launch Interceptors to make attacks.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack ground and air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/SelfRepair=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Magellan enters a state of self-repair.  It's health is restored 20 per second, but cannot move or act until fully repaired or 20 seconds has passed.</c><n/><n/>Although most science vessels are typically priority targets for most well placed strikes, Magellan has outfitted its vessel with nano repair bots that can make extremely quick repairs and recover grievous hull breaches in a matter of moments.  However - the vessel is vulnerable to further assaults as it cannot move or act while in this state.
Button/Tooltip/Sentry=<c val="ffff8a">Robotic support unit. Can use Shield Recharge, Guardian Shield, and Forcefield. </c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">None</c><n/><n/>Used to support zealots in light of the protoss race's diminishing population, sentries are protoss support drones.  Prototype sentries are equipped with a portable shield battery, offering the ability to replenish shields in the battlefield.  Sentries also offer protection through guardian shields, created by weaving light into a semi-solid state. Through this, the sentry can surround itself with an area-encompassing shield to safeguard protoss ground forces. Projectiles or energy blasts that penetrate the field lose some of their kinetic or thermal energy, and part of their effectiveness. Due to its considerable coverage radius, the guardian shield is not powerful enough to make much of a difference against larger types of ordnance.<n/><n/>Sentries can also project force field barriers to stall or split up opposing forces.This is done by turning bursts of energy into a small, impenetrable barrier to hinder, block, or funnel the advance of enemy troops. While creatures or machines of prodigious size can shatter the cohesion of these translucent force fields, ordinary soldiers and vehicles become fodder to protoss ranged weapons.
Button/Tooltip/SentryGun3=Defensive structure. Remains below ground unless an enemy target is within range.
Button/Tooltip/ShadowBlade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Artifacts Needed: 0.  Next Level: 3<n/><n/>- Slashes an enemy unit for 500 damage.  Can only target ground units.</c><n/><n/>One of the highest masteries of the warp blade is to channel the essence of the void into the Nerazim's weapon in a single, devastating strike.  Utilizing the skills learned from Tassadar in channeling his own psionic essence, Zeratul enhances this technique by merging the powers of the Nerazim with the powers of the Khalai and unleashes an attack upon a target with such potent energy that not even a mighty Archon could withstand.
Button/Tooltip/ShadowBlade2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Artifacts Needed: 3.<n/><n/>- Slashes an enemy unit for 500 damage.

Button/Tooltip/ShieldBattery=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Shield Battery uses Psi energy to replenish Protoss units' shields quickly.</c><n/><n/>The Shield Battery has a Khaydarin core that absorbs local Psi energy and contains it until it is needed by nearby Protoss warriors. By touching one of the Battery’s many energy spokes, any friendly Protoss warrior or vehicle can rapidly recharge its own shield levels. <n/><n/>The Battery does have a limited capacity, but will recharge itself over time. Careful deployment of multiple Batteries can spell the difference between victory and defeat in any campaign.
Button/Tooltip/ShieldBatteryNerazim=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Shield Battery uses Psi energy to replenish Protoss units' shields quickly.</c><n/><n/>The Shield Battery has a Khaydarin core that absorbs local Psi energy and contains it until it is needed by nearby Protoss warriors. By approaching the battery core, any friendly Protoss warrior or vessel can rapidly recharge its own shield levels. The battery does have a limited capacity, but will recharge itself over time.<n/><n/>Recently, Khalai engineers have worked together with the Nerazim to enhance the effectiveness of batteries by using specially attuned Khaydarin crystals found uniquely on Shakuras.  These crystals coarse with void-based energy, increasing the range at which the battery can restore shields by 33% and the rate at which shields are recharged by 50%.
Button/Tooltip/Shuttle=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Aerial transport.</c><n/><n/>Protoss Shuttles are used to carry ground forces into the midst of battle. These robotic flyers are heavily armored, but maintain no offensive weaponry. Shuttles are large enough to carry even the massive Reavers within their hulls.
Button/Tooltip/ShuttleLoad=Loads units into the Shuttle's bay.
Button/Tooltip/ShuttleUnloadAll=Unloads all units.
Button/Tooltip/SiegeBreaker=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Duke's heavy prototype tank/command vehicle. Long-range artillery in Siege Mode. </c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Twin 80mm Cannons<n/>120mm Mjolnir Artillery Cannon</c><n/><n/>General Edmund Duke has been a stalwart defender of the Confederacy for over forty years. Motivated by his love of power and control rather than any heartfelt political affiliation, Duke has earned a reputation for running things ‘by the book’. His long years of service with Alpha Squadron have left him with extensive tactical experience, making him one of the greatest military minds in the Terran Sector. <n/><n/>Despite his abilities, Duke’s ego and insufferable pride often lead to hostile confrontations with those under his command.
Button/Tooltip/SiegeMode=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Deploys into Siege Mode. In this mode Siege Tanks have very long range and inflict area damage. Siege Tanks in this mode cannot move or attack targets at close range.</c><n/><n/>The primary form of the Arclite Siege Tank is extremely effective, but city assaults and base defense required more firepower than even these machines could effectively provide. The solution was to provide a secondary, artillery-based mode for the tank. Once transformed into Siege Mode, the Arclite tank sacrifices mobility to deploy its awesome Shock Cannon.
Button/Tooltip/SiegeTank=<c val="FFFF8A">Heavy tank. Can be upgraded to switch into Siege Mode to provide long-range artillery support. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Twin 80mm Cannons<n/>120mm Shock Cannon</c><n/><n/>The heavily armored Arclite Siege Tank is renowned for its devastating firepower and stalwart emplacement/advance tactics. Originally designed to serve as a “final defense” security cannon, the versatility of the Goliath Walker showed that mobility was crucial in maintaining an effective military.<n/><n/>In its final form, the Siege Tank is intended to operate as a two-stage vehicle, although the first series of tanks produced were single-stage vehicles that were later upgraded.

Button/Tooltip/SingularityAnchor=Kazansky's wraith has been outfitted with a prototype reactor designed by Magellan.  It increases his apollo-class energy capacity by 100.
Button/Tooltip/Siphon=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Siphons 4 life per second from the target. Half of the life siphoned is converted into energy.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Channeled ability</c></c><n/><n/>A variant evolution of consuming zerg bio-mass, by infecting the host with airborne spores, vitality can actually be restored back to the host.  Because the process is so effective, some of the spores may rejuvenate lost energy. 
Button/Tooltip/SoulAbsorption=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Zeratul heals 20 Life and restores 20 Shields when a nearby biological unit is slain.</c><n/><n/>A controversial ability, the master dark templar is able to literally siphon the very essence of what once gave energy to the creature when slain by Zeratul's blade.  This essence can be funneled into energy to restore Zeratul's own shields and heal any wounds suffered.  To achieve such a feat is to open a small rift into the void itself upon each enemies death, something once achieved by Naraza.<n/><n/>Naraza was a female Nerazim who studied the energies of the Void in the early days of the Dark Templar's exile.  She partnered up with a fellow student, and someone far less ambitious, named Theromos. Eventually she convinced him to perform a ritual to open a rift into the void in order to channel energies that would combine the two of them into a powerful dark archon, permanently. He agreed, but was not strong enough to go through with the ritual. Naraza ignored his pleas to stop and, greedy for more power, was consumed by the Void.  This traumatic event made Theromos pledge to only teach others in the use of the Void's power.   Still, many dark templar today continue to test the limits of their power in the void without heed to the dangers.
Button/Tooltip/SpaceCowCorpse=The meaty Biomass of a fallen creature. Collect this with Kerrigan.
Button/Tooltip/SpartanCompany=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Specialized heavy-fire support unit. Excels at ground-to-air combat. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Twin 30mm Autocannons<n/>Hellfire Anti-Air Missiles</c><n/><n/>Cerberus Recon Squad is a black ops unit operating directly under Confederate High Command. There is no mention of the unit in any official military records.
Button/Tooltip/SpawnBroodling=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Launches spores which instantly kill an enemy non-robotic ground target. Instantly splits the unit into two Broodlings which attack nearby enemies.</c><n/><n/>The Queen launches a small glob of spores at an enemy ground unit. The spores attempt to “fertilise” any organic matter that they come in contact with and are capable of eating through the armored shells of Tanks and Goliaths to reach the occupants within. Victims are instantly metabolised and used to feed the growth of a pair of Broodlings, which hatch within moments. This explosive birth is fatal to the hapless host. The Broodlings are small but vicious and will attack any nearby enemies.
Button/Tooltip/SpawnNydusCanal=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Summons a new Nydus Canal at any location covered by creep.  Only one new canal can be created per morph, however, friendly ground units can use any Canal to instantly travel to any other within the Nydus Network owned by the player.</c><n/><n/>The precise origin of the Nydus Canal is unknown, and the exact process of its operation is also a mystery. The initial canal entrance is created and then, when a suitable site is found, a sister entrance can be opened. The Canal then enables Zerg ground units to travel from one end to the other at extremely high speed regardless of intervening terrain.<n/><n/>This enables multiple Hatcheries located across a large area to function as one unified nest, with Zerg warriors travelling from one combat zone to another quickly and efficiently.
Button/Tooltip/SpawningPool=<c val="ffff8a">Contains upgrades for Zerglings.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Zerglings<n/>- Sunken Colonies</c><n/><n/>Contained within the primordial ooze of the Spawning Pool is the basic genetic makeup of the most prolific of the Zerg warrior breeds, the ravenous Zergling. Once grown, the Spawning Pool provides this genetic information to any Larvae produced by the same cluster, allowing them to metamorph into Zerglings.
Button/Tooltip/Spectre=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Alexei Stukov is the Vice-Admiral of the UED fleet and longtime friend of Admiral DuGalle.</c><n/><n/>Stukov grew up on Earth, rising through the ranks of the United Powers League alongside his friend Gerard DuGalle. Both men were competitive throughout their youths and constantly played at getting the best of one another. Unlike DuGalle however, Stukov spent most of his military career in top-secret research rather than in actual combat, constantly striving to push the limit of conventional technology and physical theory to increase the effectiveness of UPL troops in warfare. His views on the subject were considered "unconventional."<n/><n/>The discovery of alien species in the Koprulu Sector changed the UPL's stance to their wayward colonies along with its own power structure. Now serving the United Earth Directorate, Stukov was appointed as second-in-command of an expeditionary force to bring the Koprulu Sector and its inhabitants under UED control.
Button/Tooltip/SpectreNukeCalldown=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Calls down a Nuclear Strike at a target location. Nukes take 20 seconds to land, but they deal 500+ damage to enemies in a large radius.</c><n/><n/>A task normally left to a ghost recon squad, the UED has authorized its flagship, the Aleksander, to paint a targeted location in order to launch a nuclear strike from a vessel in orbit.
Button/Tooltip/SpiderMine=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Spider Mines pursue enemy units that come in range, and detonate for heavy area damage. Buried Spider Mines can only be seen by enemy <c val="FFE303">Detectors</c>.</c><n/><n/>Spider mines were developed on Earth, and are one of the few technologies to survive the Long Sleep. Mines were deployed during the Guild Wars. One of the most proficient users was Victor Kachinsky, who became a Kel-Morian war hero as a result. Equipping vultures with spider mines became more popular in the late 2490's, especially on border worlds.  A spider mine burrows into the ground when deployed. When a target enters the range of its motion sensors, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>In 2499, Jaunt Pictures published the holomovie, Spider Mines IV: Death from Below, about sentient mines that turned against their creators. It was the last in the series.
Button/Tooltip/SpiderMineReplenish=Constructs a new Spider Mine to replace those destroyed.<n/><n/>Raynor can only have 3 Spider Mines built or placed at any time.

This sensory cluster gives the Spore Colony the innate ability to detect cloaked and concealed units. The Spore Colony also produces a corrosive variation of the Creep that it can launch at passing air units.
Button/Tooltip/Stalker=<c val="ffff8a">Ranged attack strider. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite"> Particle Disruptors</c><n/><n/>The fall of Aiur demonstrated to the Dark Templar that more than just stealth and guile were required to defeat the zerg. Hence, the Dark Templar developed the stalker, a war machine inspired by the Khalai dragoon. While dragoons were piloted by crippled protoss warriors, the stalker is controlled by the shadow-essence of a Dark Templar warrior fused into a metal body.  Nerazim who control stalkers undergo this process voluntarily, said process involving a Void-powered ritual which fuses their shadow essence to the machine. This gives them a preternatural degree of control over their new bodies.  Stalkers draw their psionic power from their host's connection to the Void, and are armed with carapace-mounted particle disruptors adept against both ground and aerial targets. Stalkers have been credited with many fantastic powers since their battlefield début. However, only one is witnessed consistently: an ability to instantly teleport, or "blink", from one spot to another.  This ability requires augmentation to a stalker, through the implementation of a device called a Void displacer. When enabled, the displacer grants stalkers the ability to fade and materialize instantly at a different location, affording them an unprecedented degree of mobility, perfect for quick strikes against the enemy.<n/><n/>Stalkers were in use by the Daelaam as early as 2502 and the technology stolen and replicated by the Tal'darim shortly thereafter. Some Tal'darim voluntarily chose to become stalkers in order to better hunt and kill their foes because they only wished to sharpen their combat skills and serve their Highlord, as not all Tal'darim seek ascension.

Button/Tooltip/StewartSpawnBroodlings=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Enemies damaged by Stewart become infested and will spawn 2 Broodlings with timed life if killed quickly.  No broodlings are created if Stewart kills them in a single attack.</c><n/><n/>Using part of the evolutionary hyper virus, Stewart injects his victims with a modified version of the virus that can incubate broodlings upon the target's demise.  However, the incubation period is extremely short-lived.  If the victim cannot expire before the period is over, the broodlings will never be created.  Conversely, if the unit is killed too quickly, the broodlings will never have a chance to rapidly grow and spawn from its victim's corpse.
Button/Tooltip/Stim=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Injects the unit with powerful stimulants that greatly increase attack and movement speeds for a few seconds.

Automatically spawns off-site zerg to its location periodically.  Lasts 60 seconds or until killed.</c><n/><n/>With massive amounts of biomass collected, a new strain of the Nydus worm has been created at the Queen of Blade's hive to allow even more zerg to pass through it at once as well as being able to even emerge off creep.  It accomplishes this by using triple the size fangs of normal Nydus worms that vibrate at higher than hypersonic speeds in order to crush soil, rocks and everything in between.<n/><n/>This huge creature is capable of stretching itself out to incredible lengths to support it's massive size with its own skin and ribs.  Nearby Zerg warriors can be transported quickly to the Queen of Blade's battlefield as the nydus worm can stretch indefinitely through on-demand tissue generation. 
Button/Tooltip/SunkenColony=<c val="ffff8a">Anti-ground defensive structure.

Rooting itself deep into creep via rows of sharp teeth, the colony grows multiple tendrils that it can use to attack any enemies that come within range.  The impaler colony, a creation of the Overmind, was the ancestor of the sunken colony.

However, Duran has often been known to requisition stimpacks for battlefield operations without command authorization.<n/><n/>Mysteriously, Duran doesn't seem to experience the side effects commonly found in most Terrans.  In fact, the stim almost seems to heal his tissue rather than damage it.  The exact formula for how this is accomplished is currently unknown.

Using electrical currents in micro processors and a radical new chemical composition, this stim can actually improve normal human organic healing by 10000% while simultaneously providing all the benefits of a normal stim.  Currently, only a few prototypes exist and are not yet available for standard marine issue.<n/><n/>"If the Zerg were ever to accomplish such a feat,they would truly be unstoppable." - Dominion Scientist
Button/Tooltip/SupplyDepot=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Provides supply. Supply allows you to create more units.</c><n/><n/>The Supply Depot houses all of the goods, tools, and accessories that are necessary in the day-to-day running of Terran outposts. As various encampments grow and prosper, it is necessary to provide an ever-increasing amount of supplies for colonists and military forces alike.
Button/Tooltip/SupremeInfestation=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Provides a passive bonus for Stewart.  Grants +100 health, +1 armor, +25% health regeneration and +10% movement speed bonus.</c><n/><n/>After finding secret documents belonging to Ethan Stewart's former Terran life, Kerrigan incorporated their details into the hive's neural network.  Izsha stored them and while they mostly detailed information on the events leading up to Jacob Ramsey and the preserver stored within his mind, they also contained detailed health information on Stewart.  This allowed Abathur to further adapt his infestation of Stewart to more successful methods.
Button/Tooltip/Tassadar2=<c val="ffff8a">A formerly high-ranking Executor in the Protoss armada, Tassadar was stripped of his rank after disobeying orders to annihilate Terrans in the same manner as Zerg. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Tassadar exemplifies the growing rift within Protoss society. Born into a new generation that looks ahead to a dynamic future, Tassadar is frustrated by the stoic view that his elders hold of the past. Tassadar feels that the unbending nature of the Protoss and their inability to re-evaluate ancient traditions will be the doom of his race.<n/><n/>Fascinated by the power and mysticism of the renegade Dark Templar caste, Tassadar hopes to find some way to bridge the gap between these exiles and his masters.
Button/Tooltip/TassadarMaelstrom=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Creates a containment field that prevents biological units from moving, attacking or using abilities.</c><n/><n/>A Maelstrom is a type of psionic power utilized by those who have achieved mastery over the void.

Button/Tooltip/TheMorosDevice=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Grants the ability to slow movement and attack speed to any units in a target area.</c><n/><n/>Prototype device capable of bending the fabric of space and time whereby anything caught within a small area of effect is slowed down considerably.  The technology required to accomplish this feat is decades ahead of anything the Dominion can produce.  Care should be taken to ensure Mengsk cannot get his hands on such technology.
Button/Tooltip/TitanMechMissileShot=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Paints a target location and fires a single missile at it. Deals 40 area damage around the impact point. Can fire in rapid succession for massive damage but drains 20 life per missile launched.</c><n/><n/>Perhaps the most poignant example of Terran arrogance is their ability to disregard all saftey and logic to achieve their goals.  Such is the case for what Schezar has installed aboard his goliath mech.  Using micro-fabricated installers, titan-class missiles can be quickly constructed and launched from the interrior of the goliath's primary power chamber bay.  Each missile requires a location to be targeted first before launch.  Once sent into battle, nothing can stop impact.  <n/><n/>However, these missiles were designed for large warships and not personal mechs.  In order to mass-produce these missiles and send multiple missiles towards the enmy, the goliath must be overcharged.  In doing this, Schezar sacrifices his own defense for superior offense.  Care should be met when launching multiple missiles at the enemy - and they survive for a retaliation.

Button/Tooltip/TossGrenade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Tosses a grenade that explodes for up to <d ref="Effect,TossGrenadeDamage,Amount"/> damage in a small radius. Deals double damage to structures.  </c><n/><n/>Fragmentation grenades (or simply "frag grenades") are simple, yet elegant terran weapons that are designed to disperse explosive shrapnel upon detonation.  <n/><n/>A green light shines from the tip of the grenade and is activated by pulling a pin.  Although primarily used against infantry units, the grenades explode with enough force to smash through reinforced structures.
Button/Tooltip/TossGrenadeTychus=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Launches a grenade that explodes for 100 damage in a small radius.  Deals double damage towards organics.</c><n/><n/>The AGR-28 is able to unleash a frag grenade in order to deal with smaller threats than his armor piercing rounds can handle.  The grenade explodes on impact, unleashing shrapnel in an area, ripping apart infantry with ease.  <n/><n/>Unfortunately, the design is so crude that great care must be taken when launched as friendly troops can be on the receiving end of the blast.
Button/Tooltip/Transfusion=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Instantly restores 125 life to target biological unit or structure.</c><n/><n/>The Brood Queen has evolved the original queen's ability to ensnare enemies by its mucous to instead repurpose the thick, protein-based substance to stimulate cellular growth, which she is able to expel in a more liquid form now. When the queen covers the wounds of a Zerg organism (structural or otherwise) with this reddish fluid, the damaged tissue regenerates in a matter of seconds. 
Button/Tooltip/TwilightCouncil=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Sacred learning and research center. Contains the Leg Enhancement upgrade for Zealots.</c><n/><n/>The ultimate goal of all Protoss warriors is to achieve the highest level of Khala. To this end they spend much of their time in deep meditation and sparring with each other in the floating Citadels. Named for one the greatest masters of the Khala, the Citadels of Adun are centers of learning and research for acolyte warriors.
Button/Tooltip/U238Shells=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the attack range of Marines.</c><n/><n/>These depleted uranium shells are designed to provide a greater firing range for the C-14 Gauss Rifle carried by Marines.

Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Brontolith</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Kaiser Blades</c><n/><n/>Bearing little resemblance to the docile Brontolith that they were evolved from, the dreaded Ultralisk is the most powerful of the Zerg ground forces. They serve as the backbone of the Swarm’s armies and should be considered as dangerous as any armored vehicle. These massive monstrosities are used as living battering rams against all manner of enemies. The best way to approach these creatures is from the air.
Button/Tooltip/UltraliskCavern=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Ultralisks.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Ultralisks</c><n/><n/>Deep within the shelled Cavern are numerous high-radiation deposits and dangerous substances. The extremely hostile environment within the cavern is what gives the mighty Ultralisk its unearthly toughness. Its genetic material has been subjected to countless tests and experiments, and only the final, viable code is used to provide Zerg Larvae with the key necessary to metamorph into a new Ultralisk.
Button/Tooltip/Urun=<c val="ffff8a">Elite Protoss Templar recovered from Aiur.  Can attack ground units and withstand heavy attacks to shielding.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Eredas was a protoss warrior, left wounded in stasis with two others on Aiur after its evacuation. He was the only survivor of three when an extremist group, the Fist of Ulrezaj, attacked the expedition sent to rescue them. <n/><n/>While the shrine on Aiur was destroyed to create new Dragoons, and with the current slowly diminishing in Protoss ranks, the council on Shakuras tasked Khalai engineers to devise a new cybernetic robotic model to place the battered body of Eredas.  They created a powerful new variant of the Dragoon, the Immortal.  While incapable of attacking air units like its Dragoon counterparts, Eredas' new form is able to fire twin phase canons to make short work of ground targets.  Furthermore, a new experimental shield matrix was installed to withstand powerful impacts to shielding.
Button/Tooltip/UseLockdown=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Fires an electromagnetic round that temporarily disables a mechanical or robotic unit.</c><n/><n/>The C-10 Canister Rifle can be armed with special Lockdown rounds that temporarily disable mechanised units caught within the blast.

Button/Tooltip/Val03QueenOfBlades=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Current leader of the Zerg Swarm.  Kerrigan is rapidly growing to become one of the highest class psionic users known.  She commands potent abilities augmenting both her biology and psionics.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Razor Talons | Psi Blast</c><n/><n/>During the Swarm's invasion of Tarsonis, as the Sons of Korhal withdrew, Lieutenant Sarah Kerrigan's task force was betrayed by Arcturus Mengsk and left behind. The Overmind sensed Kerrigan's formidable psychic powers and saw a great weapon against the Protoss and, perhaps, against the shackles placed on him by his Xel'naga master so long ago.  Kerrigan was captured and placed within a chrysalis, to be assimilated into the Swarm. Kerrigan was successfully infested and reborn, calling herself the "Queen of Blades".  Her psychic potential combined with the Zerg hyper-evolutionary virus transformed her into an incredible weapon against the enemies of the Swarm.<n/><n/>Following the Overmind's death on Aiur, Kerrigan was freed from its influence and began a series of manipulations against the Protoss on Shakuras and the Dominion on Korhal, including her old romantic partner, James Raynor, that ultimately crippled all opposition to her and allowed her to regain control of the entire Swarm.  By the time her intentions were made clear, it was too late and Kerrigan became the undisputed leader of the Zerg and supreme power in the Koprulu sector.<n/><n/>Mysteriously quiet recently, Kerrigan has been evolving the Swarm and herself, unlocking her true psionic potential.  She is poised to grow into a being far greater than the Overmind ever intended -  a being in which few could ever hope to match in power.

Equipped with HALO cluster rockets, Valkyries are designed for air-to-air combat, and can take substantial punishment from enemy fire before suffering any core systems failures.
Button/Tooltip/VespeneGeyser=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Workers can harvest vespene gas from this Vespene Geyser.</c><n/><n/>Vespene gas has an unusually high potential energy rating, and as such it is highly valued for use as a fuel in high-performance engines and energy reactors. The Zerg have adapted themselves to use raw Vespene as a source of nourishment to drive their greatly accelerated metabolisms. Even the Protoss require Vespene to work as a catalyst for their psi-driven machines. Geysers of this powerful green gas can be found on many planets along the Rim, and several space stations have been built over Vespene-rich asteroid belts. A refinery of some sort must be built over an active geyser to process and package the gas for its collection by the different species.<n/><n/>While an individual geyser has an effectively unlimited amount of gas within it, after a certain point the geyser “collapses” and only trace amounts of Vespene can be refined from it. Most commanders would do well to seek fresh geysers to ensure that they have enough fuel to maintain their military.

Can attack air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">MT50 Lanzer Torpedoes</c><n/><n/>A ship used to support other terran forces, Vikings are classified as air superiority fighters. The fall of the Confederacy revealed weaknesses in terran anti-air capability. Wraith combat fighters proved to be an unwieldy combination against agile zerg airborne organisms. A set of thrusters in the Viking's underbelly, which allow for hover/VTOL capabilities, and four low bypass turbines generate propulsion during flight.<n/><n/>Recent studies in the Viking prototypes have seen similarities in support functionalities between it and the Goliath.  Teams of engineers have been fervorously working to see if the Viking and Goliath can be interchanged, or modified, to contain "moving" internal parts where, similar to a siege tank design, it can switch simultaneously between its flight "fighter" mode and the goliath like "assault" mode.  For now, this design remains in testing/theory stages. 
Button/Tooltip/VoidDarkTemplarDeepShadowBlink=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Artifacts Needed: 0.  Next Level: 3<n/><n/>- Teleports Zeratul to a nearby location<n/></c><n/>Shadow walking, or blinking as it is more commonly known, is a form of short-range teleportation.  Blink is an ability mastered by many powerful dark templar including Zeratul and Raszagal.  However, it may take centuries before novice Nerazim can utilize it properly.  As dark templar gain a greater understanding of the Void they are able to convert themselves into cloud based energy to swiftly move across short distances, passing over chasms or would be predatory foes.  Additional mastery of this ability even allows its user to remain phased out of normal reality, bypassing conventional detection of Nerazim cloaking for a short while. The ability is essential as it may spell the difference between life and death in many situations.

Button/Tooltip/VoidRay=<c val="ffff8a">Surgical strike craft.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Prismatic Beam</c><n/><n/>During Ulrezaj's attack on the protoss on Shakuras, many of his followers stole prototype designs for new vessels, namely and most significantly, the Void Ray.  When the Tal'darim approached Ulrezaj's followers they were most interested in this Nerazim technology and acquired the designs for their own use.<n/><n/>The void ray is built around a prismatic core an oblong crystal of synthetic origin that serves as a virtually eternal power source. The core derives its energy from both the Void and Khala, focusing them through phase crystals, and forming a self-sustaining reaction.  <n/><n/>As the Tal'darim do not utilize the Khala, they have been so far unable to circumvent a design flaw which prevents their stolen void ray's from locking onto a target and enhancing their projectors to grow more powerful over time.  The Tal'darim highlord has decreed their engineers must repair this issue shortly, or they will suffer dire consequences.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Destruction Beam</c><n/><n/>These nefarious crafts are void rays stolen by the Tal'darim that underwent heavy modification. Instead of a prismatic core, their attacks are channeled by unstable bloodshard crystals. This creates an unstable beam that arcs between targets.  Although reports are numerous through the ranks of the Tal'darim of Destroyers overloading and exploding in mid flight if the crystals are knocked out of alignment, the Tal'darim highlord has decreed their usefulness in obliterating groups of enemies against their order outweigh the risks.

This barrier is capable of withstanding energy output of projectiles such as a rifle slug, a hydralisk spine, or even a photon cannon blast.  While the effect is short lived, it is made considerably shortly when damaged by traditional close proximity weapons.  Care should be used when being surrounded by such creatures as zerglings or zealots.

Its hull is a conductive framework that can absorb most types of energy by disspating the energy of incoming strikes across the hull. It houses thousands of psionic micro-receptors, which channel the power of the prism's crystal core and project "wings" laced with psionic energies. An automated vessel, the warp prism is controlled by a robotic mind created through a psionic manufacturing process. Though fragile, no protoss fleet is complete without them.<n/><n/>The protoss use warp prisms in several ways. The primary function of a warp prism is to transport protoss forces on the battlefield. On reaching the desired destination the operation is reversed and the stored energy signatures are reconfigured into matter in proximity to the warp prism.  A secondary but no less vital function of the warp prism is to act as a mobile focus for the protoss psionic matrix. Opening a containment field around its power core, once the prism is deployed it can power protoss structures around it. In this configuration warp prisms can be used to temporarily replace destroyed pylons in a colony or enable the rapid establishment of a forward base of operations.

After their banishment from Aiur, the dark templar found Shakuras and the temple, and decided to remain there to study it.  The Nerazim calling Shakuras home postulated only the ancient twin crystals, Uraj and Khalis, could properly channel the temple's energies.  The temple's effects may have been able to reach out in space at one time, but age has reduced its total energy output.   <n/><n/>The temple consists of a pyramid-shaped structure with a small floating crystalline top. he temple itself is protected by powerful shields.  Crystals inside are revered by the guardians of the temple. The temple contains mysteries such as a substance with a smell similar to the drug Sundrop.  Compared to the "wild" temples found on many distant worlds, this particular temple on Shakuras has been described as more "structured".

Button/Tooltip/ZeratulVoidAiur01=<c val="ffff8a">Praetor of the Dark Templar, Zeratul possesses powerful psionic abilities and is a master of harnessing the void. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Master Warp Blade</c><n/><n/>Like all of his dark brethren, Zeratul was banished from the Protoss homeworld long ago for refusing to submit his will to the 'communal glory' of the Khala. Because of this, Zeratul long harbored a deep-seated hatred for the Protoss Conclave and the Judicator caste who were responsible for his wrongful exile.  That all changed when the Zerg came to the Koprulu sector.<n/><n/>Just before Aiur was overrun by the Swarm, Zeratul was lured to Char from the powerful psionic emanations of Kerrigan, generated subconsciously in her chrysalises.  Once realizing the source, Zeratul sought to put an end to the Zerg found there.  Instead, he met the former protoss executor Tassadar, also led by the same psionic calls, as well as the terran Jim Raynor.  Eventually they both overcame each others prejudice, beginning to heal the rifts between the Khalai and the Nerazim.<n/><n/>After the rebirth of Kerrigan, Tassadar distracted her long enough for Zeratul to slay Zasz, cerebrate and leader of the Garm Brood. This created a connection between Zeratul and the Overmind, which enabled Zeratul to discern the Overmind's motives but conversely allowed the Overmind itself to discern the secret location of Aiur and begin its invasion of his homeworld and the genocide of his entire race.  This dark secret of how the Swarm came to invade Aiur with such precision is currently known only to Zeratul and the late Tassadar.  Zeratul is careful not to reveal these thoughts to his brethren, less all of the healing bonds accomplished since the Khalai and Nerazim rejoined at Shakuras would become in jeopardy.  As a result, this secret has created a heavy burden for the dark prelate to carry with him.

Param/Value/lib_9770F675_0394202F=Just a little of that and…there we go.  With this extra iridium I can increase this slug’s range further and stronger.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_11250611=All these doors are locked…I’ll need to use an explosive charge to open them…but which ones should we open?
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_191AEE04=DuGalle
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_1C3229ED=SkipSkip
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_22ADCBB4=That should do it.  Using the extra force from this iridium these bullets should be able to pierce through vehicle armor better.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_31D1FCC4=That’s it!  With enough of this palladium the selfix healing protocol can be improved further and with less time between recharges.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_3899FC06=Impressive.  With enough of this palladium I can install a self-repair protocol, although I need to be out of combat to use it.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_3CAE07C2=Meanwhile, Kerrigan continued to hunt down any psionic signatures belonging to laboratories for Duran's Hybrid experiments, but each turned up abandoned.  The Queen of the Zerg feared her old consort was either beginning to relocate his experiments to safer locations, or his Hybrids were already awakening, preparing for an assault when the time was right.  Finally, one of her organic probes picked up a powerful emanation coming from the Terran world of Emoja.  A live Hybrid was there no doubt.  Re-directing her Leviathan, she sent her forces at full force towards the Dominion occupied world.  Although Kerrigan was not looking to begin her true assault on Mengsk, this strike on a Dominion holding would be as good as any for a first strike.

Param/Value/lib_9770F675_47BF9E3C=<s val="Campaign_Title">                  Episode IV - Enslavers Epilogue</s><n/><n/>With the threat of the supreme Dark Archon Ulrezaj now contained deep under Ehlna within a khaydarin crystal, due to the noble sacrifice of the preserver Zamara, the Nerazim on Shakuras were able to secure their once secret moon  away from Kerrigan's Zerg and the Terran Dominion.  An uneasy stalemate was met between the three races as they each went back to their respective territories.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_49567638=</s>
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_4F8DCCB1=Perfect, with enough iridium my bullets should be able to tear through infantry and zerg a little easier.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_67B3BBE6=This raw iridium is incredible.  The energy output in these bullets is capable of ripping through even the largest units now!
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_73EAFB53=Perfect.  That should help a bit.  The palladium upgrade should improve my suit and even improve my suit’s movement.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_8A5516F9=Nothing can penetrate my carapace!
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_8B780309=Ah the Protoss have gathered raw iridium.  There may be more to find around here.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_9058B581=And nearby, waking up to a crisp morning breakfast, the former Dominion Alpha Squadron Commander began going over his strategy for liberating the civilians on an outpost near a secret Dominion military outpost on Emoja.  Over the past several years since the fight on Aiur, the Commander and his loyal followers had become freedom fighters, liberating civilians from Dominion or mercenary oppression.  Requiring more resources than he had to pull this plan off, the Commander knew he had to call in a favor to make this work.  And he had one favor he's been saving up for such an occasion.  Time to ante up Jimmy...
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_92AF11D0=Life returned to an uneasy quiet, but for both Zeratul and Kerrigan, things were anything but quiet.  Both the Dark Prelate and Queen of Blades were still consumed with searching for their own answers as to what the Hybrid threat they both encountered were and how the creature known as Duran was able to create them.  Abandoning their kin, they each went on a unique journey to seek out these answers.  Zeratul began his search on the world Zamara had showed him containing a Xel'naga temple - Pegasus.  Zeratul arrived on the world just in time to witness an unusual energy-like creature emerge from the decayed temple and depart into space. The prelate followed it to a gathering of dozens, possibly hundreds, of other energy creatures. The creatures then created a wormhole through which Zeratul cautiously ventured forth...
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_B0084E76=Incredible.  Using this raw palladium I can decrease the time it takes before my suit starts repairing itself!
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_B736BF71=This…is it.  Using the last of this raw palladium I can use an ionized force field to generate a personal shield matrix around me…although the effect will only last temporarily and will break down against close ranged strikes.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_CE36D69A=Powerful Khaydarin crystals...they contain potent psi essence.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_D1DD663B=The energy...I can feel my power growing...
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_D38C1BCE=Perfect…with enough of this iridium I can improve my rifle’s firing speed.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_F46B1DBB=My blades are itching for victims...
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_F5F73E3B=There, that should do it.  This extra palladium should improve my combat suit.
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_F896FD68=The last of the raw iridium.  With this, I can create shock bullets to temporarily blind targets!  I’m coming for you Schezar!
Param/Value/lib_9770F675_FF480304=Raw Palladium.  There may be more around here to find.

Weapon/Tip/ATALaserBattery=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Behemoth-class Battlecruiser's twin-cannon laser batteries work well against both air and ground targets.  These batteries are located across the Battlecruiser's hull and are used primarily for aerial defense and surface bombardment. They are equipped with advanced optics and sensors to deal with fast moving targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ATALaserBatteryHyperion=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Hyperion's multiple laser batteries work well against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/AcidSpew=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The Spore Colony is able to fling seeker spores (a corrosive variation of creep) high into the atmosphere, spore colonies can quickly ravage any incoming enemy air force.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ArbiterMPWeapon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Phase disruptors launch bolts of anti-particles through a psychically charged field.  These weapons fire antimatter bolts sheathed in a psychically charged field.<n/><n/>Arbiters employ a modified variant of the Phase Disruptor in order to fend off incoming attacks.  However, the weapon's field output is hindered by its temporal systems. As such, its overall power is reduced when compared to Dragoons or Photon Cannons.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ArcliteShockCannon=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The experimental 120mm Mjolnir Artillery Cannon fires plasma shells in contrast to the standard explosives of the Shock Cannon. Effective in "scorched earth" operations. <n/><n/>Like the standard Arclite tank, Duke's command vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated targeting system, able to identify heat sources and their range.
Weapon/Tip/ArmageddonCannons=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The super-class Aleksander's twin-cannon Armageddon cannons work well against both air and ground targets.  These batteries are located across the Aleksander's hull and are used primarily for aerial defense and surface bombardment. They are equipped with advanced optics and sensors to deal with fast moving targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BacklashRockets=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Backlash rocket is a type of stinger missile used as a form of air-to-ground ordnance. The rocket's high explosive warhead is lined with plasteel, and is designed to burn through the heaviest neosteel plating known to humanity. <n/><n/>The shoddy guidance systems in these munitions, coupled with massive collateral damage in urban settings, have earned the Banshee an infamous reputation as a Dominion terror weapon.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BattleCruiserLoki=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">When enemies are attempting to close in on the Aleksander, it deploys its powerful twin-laser Serpentis batteries, which can deliver a quick end to short-ranged targets, both air and ground alike.  These batteries are located on the front hull of the massive flagship where they can easily be fired for short ranged targets.
Weapon/Tip/C10CanisterRifle=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The C-10 is a canister rifle issued to ghosts.  A relatively obscure weapon at the time, the C-10 quickly became standard deployment to Ghosts by 2491.<n/><n/>The C-10 mainly fires 25mm high explosive rounds.  This version was also equipped with a special underslung low frequency targeting laser that was used to guide tactical nuclear missiles to their target with pinpoint accuracy. It was also capable of using a variety of special munitions, including lockdown rounds that temporarily disabled mechanized units caught within the blast.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Claws=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Zerglings possess sickle limbs and sharp incisor teeth, used primarily for tearing into flesh.<n/><n/>Further mutations may be made to zergling DNA, namely the mutation of their adrenal glands, changing their glandular balance to induce a battle frenzy.  These adrenal glands have been observed to be unusually large for a creature of the zergling's size.  Further analysis has revealed evidence of genetic manipulation, which also increased zergling aggression, driving them into a state of frenzy. In such a state, zerglings can bring down armored vehicles and structures with ease.</c>
Weapon/Tip/DanimothWeapon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Phase disruptors launch bolts of anti-particles through a psychically charged field.  These weapons fire antimatter bolts sheathed in a psychically charged field.<n/><n/>Arbiters employ a modified variant of the Phase Disruptor in order to fend off incoming attacks.  However, the weapon's field output is hindered by its temporal systems. As such, its overall power is reduced when compared to Dragoons or Photon Cannons.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Devourer=
Weapon/Tip/DevourerMPWeapon=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">From their tail, a Devourer is able to spit a venom of corrosive acid at aerial targets that can eat through the reinforced armor plating of terran and protoss capital ships.  The initial damage these globs inflict is not insignificant, but as spores build up on targets, they will eat through hull plating on the molecular level, making it easier for other attacks to penetrate ship armor.<n/><n/>The acid spores in the venom may hinder the fighting ability of the target, such as reducing an enemy ship's time to reload weapons and will reveal cloaked units.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Diamondback=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Eviscerator rail guns were originally developed by the Terran Confederacy for their diamondback tanks. They are lightweight, easy to operate, and able to be fired by diamondbacks while they move.  Railguns have a particular knack for burning through reinforced plating, making them ideal tank hunters.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Dragoon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Dragoons provide essential supporting fire for the Zealot forces by launching bolts of antiparticles sheathed in a psychically charged field. These disintegration bolts are effective against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Firebat=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Perdition was the standard issue weapon of Koprulu Sector firebats by the late 2490's.  The combusto-plasma fuel is stored in containment fields but pose an explosive hazard if the fields are breached violently.  The plasma fuel easily seeps between gaps in zerg armor; smaller strains are literally cooked alive in their own skin.<n/><n/>Firebats are careful about utilizing perdition flamethrowers and only do so when all squad members in the firing radius has fully functioning CMC Powered Combat Suits, as the backfire can lead to catching allies on fire.</c>
Weapon/Tip/FusionCutter=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">SCVs are known to be outfitted with various feedback modules to help improve pilot feedback and performance. <n/><n/>One such module is the onboard force feedback module (or OFFM, referred to as OFF ME), which allows the SCV pilot to move the SCV arms and generate a force proportional to the motions of the pilot, allowing for greater range of movement and greater combat effectiveness against close range attackers such as zerglings using their onboard fusion cutters, normally used to harvest minerals.</c>
Weapon/Tip/GantrithorInterceptorLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The maneuverable, computer-guided Interceptors tear through enemy flight formations and relentlessly strafe slower targets with potent plasma-charges. Manufactured and serviced inside of the Carrier bays, a number of prepped Interceptors can be launched in rapid succession.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Ghost=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The C-10 is a canister rifle issued to ghosts.  A relatively obscure weapon at the time, the C-10 quickly became standard deployment to Ghosts by 2491.<n/><n/>The C-10 mainly fires 25mm high explosive rounds.  This version was also equipped with a special underslung low frequency targeting laser that was used to guide tactical nuclear missiles to their target with pinpoint accuracy. It was also capable of using a variety of special munitions, including lockdown rounds that temporarily disabled mechanized units caught within the blast.</c>
Weapon/Tip/GoliathA=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Goliath features a computer-based heavy weapons system.  It's standard anti-air armament consists of Hellfire-AA scatter missiles.  As such, Goliaths are primarily used against aerial targets.<n/><n/>Goliaths were further upgraded with the arrival of the United Earth Directorate in the Koprulu Sector. With improved propulsion technologies via Charon Boosters and upgrades to existing targeting system software, the goliath's range via its Hellfire missiles was increased dramatically.</c>
Weapon/Tip/GoliathG=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Goliath has anti-armor 30mm smoothbore autocannons attached in both arms as its primary armament against ground targets. The autocannons fire explosive shells that can pierce the armor of most ground targets.  <n/><n/>As such, while goliaths are primarily used against aerial targets, they still pose a great threat to infantry.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Guardian=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The Guardian attacks by lobbing explosive gobs of acid which have a much longer range than the Mutalisk’s spray. This acid can only be directed at targets on the ground below. <n/><n/>Guardians have no natural defenses against aerial opponents.</c>
Weapon/Tip/GuardianMPWeapon=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The Guardian attacks by lobbing explosive gobs of acid which have a much longer range than the Mutalisk’s spray. This acid can only be directed at targets on the ground below. <n/><n/>Guardians have no natural defenses against aerial opponents.</c>
Weapon/Tip/GuassRifle=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Marines' standard-issue C-14 Impaler Gauss Rifle fires 8mm metal “spikes” at hypersonic speeds. The rounds are designed to provide maximum penetration against all armor types. To preserve both ammo usage and minimise power requirements, the rifle uses a capacitor system to fire in short, controlled bursts.</c>
Weapon/Tip/HaloRockets=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">HALO cluster rockets are fired in volleys, using a targeting system to scatter the rockets for a large area of effect. The dispersal radius of the targeting system is designed to achieve maximum damage to not only its intended target, but also adjacent targets within the blast area.</c>
Weapon/Tip/HighTemplarWeapon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Some powerful Protoss are capable of sending out a short range, quick burst of psionic energy, damaging a nearby target.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Hydralisk=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Hydralisks strike from a distance with volleys of armor-piercing spines, up to 30cm in length.  Hundreds of these spines are stored in the upper carapace plates and covered by flaps.<n/><n/>The hydralisk has 4,000 muscles, compared to a terran's 629, and a portion of these may be used to launch the spines with enough force to penetrate 2 cm. of neosteel at a range of over 300 meters or even half a kilometer at a velocity greater than that of the C-20A rifle, moving at near hypersonic speeds. The spines were evolved from the slothien's defensive urticating hairs; they may also be "grooved" for increased range.</c>
Weapon/Tip/InfernalFlameThrower=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The infernal flamethrower projects a burst of ignited plasma fuel, which is deadly against lightly armored targets. Two shielded tanks in the central area of the hellion hold the volatile mixture, and offer an adequate supply of fuel for skirmishes. <n/><n/>However, the unreliability of the ignition system meant hellion drivers would only have to use a lighter, or even a cigarette, to ignite the weapon. This led to the development of a better fuel mix and the infernal pre-igniter, which won't go out even in poor weather conditions.</c>
Weapon/Tip/InterceptorLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The maneuverable, computer-guided Interceptors tear through enemy flight formations and relentlessly strafe slower targets with potent plasma-charges. Manufactured and serviced inside of the Carrier bays, a number of prepped Interceptors can be launched in rapid succession.</c>
Weapon/Tip/KaiserBlades=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Ultralisks attack using large, bone-like scythes which protrude from their backs. Known as "kaiser blades", these scythes are nearly indestructible.  <n/><n/>Possessing monomolecular edges, these scythes are able to tear through most substances with ease, able to slice through armored vehicle and eviscerate entire squads of light infantry in just a few swipes.  The density, bevel, and edges of these organic weapons are honed at the genetic level.</c>
Weapon/Tip/LanzerTorpedoes=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The MT50 lanzer torpedo is an air-to-air weapon used by the Viking, with developments in retrofitting illegal variants of Goliaths with the deadly weapon. Their armor-piercing warheads are particuarly effective against capital ships, but their impact on lighter vessels is diminished.</c>
Weapon/Tip/LongboltMissile=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Using the relatively inexpensive Longbolt weaponry, a Missile Turret is equipped with an effective anti-air armament.  It's targeting system may be set to computer controlled in order to automatically engage aerial targets without the need for a human controller.  <n/><n/>Due to this feature, it is quite common to see entire rows of unmanned Missile Turrets outfitted on low-orbit blockades around planets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Lurker=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Lurkers emit waves of super-dense spines against their enemies, having a full width of damage of ten meters. Any warriors on the surface who are caught by these spines are instantly impaled. These spines themselves are capable of tearing into flesh, steel, and even reinforced armor plating.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Marine=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Marines' standard-issue C-14 Impaler Gauss Rifle fires 8mm metal “spikes” at hypersonic speeds. The rounds are designed to provide maximum penetration against all armor types. To preserve both ammo usage and minimise power requirements, the rifle uses a capacitor system to fire in short, controlled bursts.</c>
Weapon/Tip/MengskDiamondback=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Eviscerator rail guns were originally developed by the Terran Confederacy for their diamondback tanks. They are lightweight, easy to operate, and able to be fired by diamondbacks while they move.  Railguns have a particular knack for burning through reinforced plating, making them ideal tank hunters.</c>
Weapon/Tip/MengskFirebat=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Gui's custom made flamethrower nearly doubles the legal output of standard Dominion firebat's perdition flamethrowers.  Officers have been told to "look the other way" when inspecting his equipment.</c>
Weapon/Tip/MengskSiegeTank=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to the AAV-5 Arclite weaponry, the Shock Division's mobile armament consists of twin 90mm PPG-7 plasma cannons that, while not nearly as destructive as its sieged shock cannon counterpart, can still render targets to ash when the need for mobility arises.<n/><n/>With the slightly increased barrel size, total damge is actually decreased when compared to standard Arclites.  However, the speed at which the cannons can reload more than makes up for this.</c>
Weapon/Tip/MengskSiegeTankSieged=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to the AAV-5 Arclite "Shock Cannon", this model increases the barrel width allowing it to achieve feats in which standard tanks cannot.  While its total damage output may be less than its Arclite counterparts, the speed at which it can reload its payload more than makes up for it.</c>
Weapon/Tip/MengskWraithA=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The primary weapon of the Kazansky's Wraith.  Similar in design to current generation Wraiths, the Mark II missiles unleashes a double payload from dual chambers on each attack, making short work of any enemy craft.</c>
Weapon/Tip/MengskWraithG=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Tom's custom designed Wraith uses a similar variant of the CF/A-17 Wraith's 25mm burst laser as air-to-ground armament. However, Magellan helped to increase piercing damage by utilizing dual laser chambers in a single blast.  This has caught many marines unprepared for the heavy assault this wraith can deal to ground forces.  <n/><n/>It is rumored that this model has gained interest in the Dominion for new ways to handle civilian unrest from air to ground forces.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Mutalisk=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The mutalisk spawns small, voracious creatures called "glaive wurms", and projects these creatures to attack. Glaive wurms fly between multiple targets as they degrade explosively.  The mutalisk's reproductive system--its ovipositor--has been adapted into a weapon delivery system.</c>
Weapon/Tip/NeedleClaws=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Small but sharp claws are used by the Broodling when grown rapidly from globs of spores launched from nearby Queens.  Upon hatching these vicious creatures will attack any nearby enemies until either they or the broodlings are destroyed.  Their effectiveness is primarily compromised, however, by their very limited lifespans</c>
Weapon/Tip/NeedleSpines=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Hydralisks strike from a distance with volleys of armor-piercing spines, up to 30cm in length.  Hundreds of these spines are stored in the upper carapace plates and covered by flaps.<n/><n/>The hydralisk has 4,000 muscles, compared to a terran's 629, and a portion of these may be used to launch the spines with enough force to penetrate 2 cm. of neosteel at a range of over 300 meters or even half a kilometer at a velocity greater than that of the C-20A rifle, moving at near hypersonic speeds. The spines were evolved from the slothien's defensive urticating hairs; they may also be "grooved" for increased range.</c>
Weapon/Tip/NeedleSpines2=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Drones are usually single-minded about their tasks, diligently working through even raging combat.  However, in a pinch, the drone's pincers can be used to fend off minor threats to the hive.  <n/><n/>The pincers are a minor evolution of those possessed by larvae, which gives them the ability to clamp and transport objects. The osseous tissue hardens through the pupation cycle, and its density allows drones to cut mineral crystals with ease, or defend themselves when threatened.</c>
Weapon/Tip/NeutronFlare=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Neutron flares are a protoss technology developed by the Nerazim for their Corsairs, using neutron emitters to fire bursts of energy. They are used in ship-to-ship combat, and can take attack light aircraft in a small area around their target. Neutron flares can also channel psionic static, creating a disruption web that affects ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Nova=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The latest version of the C-10 rifle issued to Ghost agents, the Mark VI can be used both as an automatic weapon and as an anti-personnel sniper rifle. Kerrigan generally prefers the latter.<n/><n/>The Mk. VI is also equipped with a flashlight, can fire EMP rounds, and has retained the low frequency targeting laser that is used to guide tactical nuclear missiles to their intended destination. The accuracy of Ghosts has improved thanks to the Mk. VI containing a magnetic grid tracker to verify coordinates.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ParticleBeam=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Particle beams are miniature energy projectors used by protoss probes.  They have been in use since the Protoss Empire first began. While particle beams are commonly used to collect samples and mineral crystals, the beam can be boosted to cause kinetic damage to targets deemed a threat.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ParticleDisruptors=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Dragoons provide essential supporting fire for the Zealot forces by launching bolts of antiparticles sheathed in a psychically charged field. These disintegration bolts are effective against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/PerditionTurretFlamethrower=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Perdition was the standard issue weapon of Koprulu Sector firebats by the late 2490's. The combusto-plasma fuel is stored in containment fields but pose an explosive hazard if the fields are breached violently.  The plasma fuel easily seeps between gaps in zerg armor; smaller strains are literally cooked alive in their own skin.<n/><n/>As less and less firebat-class soldiers have been reporting to duty, scavenged flamethrowers were used for automated Perdition turret defenses</c>
Weapon/Tip/PhaseDisruptors=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to standard Dragoon phase disruptors, the Immortal's primary weapon fires antimatter bolts. However, in order to achieve a significant damage improvement, the Immortal has been outfitted with dual phase disruptors that can fire their antimatter bolts sheathed in pure energy. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents immortals from engaging aerial targets.  <n/><n/>With complements of standard Dragoons still a viable anti-air option for the weary Protoss armada on Aiur, there doesn't appear to be a need to develop a new exoskeleton model for this need...yet.</c>
Weapon/Tip/PhaseDisruptors3=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to standard Dragoon phase disruptors, the Immortal's primary weapon fires antimatter bolts. However, in order to achieve a significant damage improvement, the Immortal has been outfitted with dual phase disruptors that can fire their antimatter bolts sheathed in pure energy. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents immortals from engaging aerial targets.  <n/><n/>With complements of standard Dragoons still a viable anti-air option for the weary Protoss armada on Aiur, there doesn't appear to be a need to develop a new exoskeleton model for this need...yet.</c>
Weapon/Tip/PhaseDisruptors32=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to standard Dragoon phase disruptors, the Immortal's primary weapon fires antimatter bolts. However, in order to achieve a significant damage improvement, the Immortal has been outfitted with dual phase disruptors that can fire their antimatter bolts sheathed in pure energy. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents immortals from engaging aerial targets.  <n/><n/>With complements of standard Dragoons still a viable anti-air option for the weary Protoss armada on Aiur, there doesn't appear to be a need to develop a new exoskeleton model for this need...yet.</c>
Weapon/Tip/PhotonCannon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The Photon Cannon fires an encapsulated antimatter sphere similar to that generated by the Dragoon. It is an effective weapon against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Predator=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Robotic research has previously used insects and animals in their model designs but none has achieved great success like the Predator.  By closing in the distance to its targets, this mechanical beast's claws can rip apart almost anything with great ease.  <n/><n/>Furthermore, top-secret research into Protoss energy grids have led to a new addition whereby a discharged deadly field of electricity is released each time it attacks.  How the robotic claw is able to achieve this amount of energy output without exploding is still ongoing in Dominion research.</c>
Weapon/Tip/PsiDischarge=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Some powerful high templars are capable of sending out a short range, quick burst of psionic energy, damaging a nearby target.</c>
Weapon/Tip/PsionicShockwave=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The psionic shockwave is a psionic power possessed by Archons. Using their rage and will, they are able to direct their own energy as a weapon. The powerful blasts produced rip organic tissue apart, causing massive damage through rapid cellular degeneration and the transfer of thermal energy. <n/><n/>While psionic shockwaves are most effective against biological targets, even heavy plating yields before their might.</c>
Weapon/Tip/PunisherGrenades=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Quad K12 "Punisher" grenade launcher is mounted on each arm, each of which can deploy hundreds of grenades. The K-12 was originally designed to crack hardened-zerg carapaces, but its payload are able to decimate structures and armor as well.<n/><n/>A fully automated weapon system, the K12 can deliver armor-piercing Punisher grenades to large or small ground targets. The weapon's autoloader assembly also boasts a miniature manufacturing plant that replenishes the suit's ammunition stores while in the field, allowing the marauder to fight through drawn out engagements without the need to resupply. Energy for the manufacturing process is supplied by an auxiliary power generator mounted on the back of the marauder's 5-4 Armored Infantry Suit.</c>
Weapon/Tip/QueenOfBladesPsiBlast=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Kerrigan is able to summon a small amount of pure psionic energy and launch it at a ranged target.  Although not as efficient as her melee claws, this psionic blast is Kerrigan's only method of combating aerial targets or to attack ground targets from a distance until they are close enough for her deadly claws.</c>
Weapon/Tip/RaynorSpiderMines=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">When a target enters the motion sensor range of a burried spider-mine, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Groups of mines can share sensor data making it difficult to traverse a spider mine field undetected.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>Spider mines were developed on Earth, and are one of the few technologies to survive the Long Sleep.</c>
Weapon/Tip/RazorTalons=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Kerrigan is capable of eviscerating her targets with extremely sharp and durable claws extending from her hands.  She is also quite fond of using her long wing-like talons protruding from her back to impale her victims or to pry open the hulls of ground robotics or vehicles.<n/><n/>Kerrigan's numerous razor-sharp attacks have inspired her to create a nickname for her new form - "Queen of Blades".  The nickname has already spread fear among the Dominion and Raynor's Raiders, both of whom fought her on Char when she first emerged from her chrysalis.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ReaverScarabsLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Reavers house and construct tiny robotic drones called Scarabs. The Scarabs are launched in groups at enemy targets or installations. Unlike the Interceptors found on Protoss Carriers, the Scarabs do not return to the Reaver after they attack. Instead, they explode on impact, generating devastating electromagnetic fields that cause heavy damage to their targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Scourge=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Catalytic agents within the scourge allow it to undergo a form of plasma metamorphosis, causing it to explode like a living bomb. A single scourge is capable of destroying a terran starfighter or shuttle and a handful can breach the hull of a starship.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ScoutAir=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Antimatter missiles are a protoss technology and the primary anti-air armament of the scout. They are outfitted with an antimatter payload. They are designed to destroy heavier aerial targets, allowing the scout to serve as a fleet escort.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ScoutGround=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The Photon Blaster is a protoss technology and anti-ground armament for the scout. They are used for light harassment, when scouts are called upon for ground operations. Scouts are outfitted with two of them.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ScoutMPAir=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Antimatter missiles are a protoss technology and the primary anti-air armament of the scout. They are outfitted with an antimatter payload. They are designed to destroy heavier aerial targets, allowing the scout to serve as a fleet escort.</c>
Weapon/Tip/ScoutMPGround=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The Photon Blaster is a protoss technology and anti-ground armament for the scout. They are used for light harassment, when scouts are called upon for ground operations. Scouts are outfitted with two of them.</c>
Weapon/Tip/SiegeBreaker=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">When mobile, Duke's armament consists of twin 90mm PPG-7 plasma cannons.  These weapons are notably stronger than standard mobile Arclite weaponry.</c>
Weapon/Tip/SiegeTank=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">AAV-5 Arclite weaponry was renowned throughout the Confederacy for its heavy firepower and stalwart emplacement/advance tactics.  It's primary attack, a 120mm "shock cannon", was originally designed to be a static "final defense" weapon against insurrection from the Guild Wars.  However, the conflict demonstrated the need for mobility and as a result an effort was made to make the cannon more mobile.<n/><n/>When mobile, Arclite armament consists of twin 80mm PPG-7 plasma cannons that, while not nearly as destructive as its sieged shock cannnon counterpart, can still render targets to ash when the need for mobility arises.</c>
Weapon/Tip/SiegeTankSieged=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">AAV-5 Arclite weaponry was renowned throughout the Confederacy for its heavy firepower and stalwart emplacement/advance tactics.  When sieged the previously mobile twin 80mm PPG-7 plasma cannons are rapidly converted into the 120mm Shock Cannon.  This weapon had been worked on even before the "dual-mode" Arclite model was created and was designed to be a static "final defense" cannon against insurrection from the Guild Wars.<n/><n/>Capable of decimating entire squadrons in seconds, the shock cannon is both feared and respected throughout any military organization that uses them.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Suicide2=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Infested terrans can explode, sacrificing themselves in a splash of toxic fluid. The resulting explosion has a ten meter radius, a large shockwave and can destroy small structures.</c>
Weapon/Tip/TychusChaingun=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The AGR-14 was used to train Confederate Marine Corps recruits and old models existed as far back as 2478. The Commander's rirfle has been used throughout his military career and has been modified to increase damage and firing speed than typical models.  The rifle is highly modifiable to allow it to achieve devestating results.<n/><n/>The AGR-14 fires at supersonic speeds and makes a very intimidating roar when it does so. It is capable of firing jacketless slugs that can tear through with great effectiveness both standard organics up to the reinforced plating of a tank.  With the right components it can even fire small ultrasonic pulses to briefly daze victims.</c>
Weapon/Tip/TychusCommandoChaingun=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The AGR-28 was only manufactured in very small amounts before it was deemed illegal by the Confederate government.  As such, its one of the most valued gauss type rifle across all of the Dominion.  The weapon, while deadly in its own right, can fire armor piercing rounds that can breach the hulls of nearly any mechanical armor type.<n/><n/>A grenade launcher can be attached in secondary fire mode to clear the way against infantry incursions.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Ultralisk=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Ultralisks attack using large, bone-like scythes which protrude from their backs. Known as "kaiser blades", these scythes are nearly indestructible.  <n/><n/>Possessing monomolecular edges, these scythes are able to tear through most substances with ease, able to slice through armored vehicle and eviscerate entire squads of light infantry in just a few swipes.  The density, bevel, and edges of these organic weapons are honed at the genetic level.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Vulture=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The AGP-2 "Thumper" grenade launcher is the primary armament of the Vulture hover cycle.  These grenades are simple, yet elegant terran anti-personnel weapons that are designed to disperse shrapnel upon exploding.  These weapons, however, are ill-advised to use against reinforced hull or structure plating.</c>
Weapon/Tip/VultureSpiderMines=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">When a target enters the motion sensor range of a burried spider-mine, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Groups of mines can share sensor data making it difficult to traverse a spider mine field undetected.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>Spider mines were developed on Earth, and are one of the few technologies to survive the Long Sleep.</c>
Weapon/Tip/WarbringerScarabsLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Reavers house and construct tiny robotic drones called Scarabs. The Scarabs are launched in groups at enemy targets or installations. Unlike the Interceptors found on Protoss Carriers, the Scarabs do not return to the Reaver after they attack. Instead, they explode on impact, generating devastating electromagnetic fields that cause heavy damage to their targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/WarpBlades=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The origins of the warp blade lie on the Xel'Naga ship the Nerazim departed Aiur in. Gaining access to new knowledge, the Nerazim used the psi-blade as a template to forge an instrument with which to shape their burgeoning psionic ability, and infuse it with Void energy.<n/><n/>Warp blades react to the user's strength of will, turning centuries of discipline and training into a powerful weapon. Further iterations on its design yielded scythe-like blades, which helped diversify the combat style of the Dark Templar.</c>
Weapon/Tip/WraithA=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The primary weapon of the Wraith.  In addition to burst air to ground lasers, the standard CF/A-17G Wraith has equipped Gemini-class "air to air" missiles.  Most effective against other vessels, a squadron can bring down slower targets such as the massive Battlecruisers or even Protoss capital ships.</c>
Weapon/Tip/WraithG=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The new G variant of the CF/A-17 Wraith model introduced a belly-mounted 25mm burst laser as air-to-ground armament. Its design was spurred by the lack of an effective terran air-to-ground fighter below battlecruiser weight.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Zealot=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Zealots are armed with psionic blades channelled through the forearm units of their power suits.  The Khalai's refinement of the focussers in these units allow the psi-blades to increase in power as a zealot's rage increases in battle.  The blades can tear through armored structures and vehicles with ease.<n/><n/>The zealots' mastery of their emotions mean they can fight longer, harder, and better than their adversaries. A handful of zealots can easily control an entire colony of lesser species.</c>
Weapon/Tip/Zergling=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Zerglings possess sickle limbs and sharp incisor teeth, used primarily for tearing into flesh.<n/><n/>Further mutations may be made to zergling DNA, namely the mutation of their adrenal glands, changing their glandular balance to induce a battle frenzy.  These adrenal glands have been observed to be unusually large for a creature of the zergling's size.  Further analysis has revealed evidence of genetic manipulation, which also increased zergling aggression, driving them into a state of frenzy. In such a state, zerglings can bring down armored vehicles and structures with ease.</c>
