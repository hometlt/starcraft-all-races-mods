Orion's Halo Asset mod!

Contains Halo and miscellanious assets created by Orion, et. al.

Unless otherwise specified, assets in this mod were created by Orion. Please ask for permission before using the assets present
in this mod. Do not modify assets created by Orion.

ALL ASSETS ARE PRESENTED "AS IS" WITH NO GUARANTEES OF QUALITY OR WORKING PROPERLY. I am NOT a professional modeler, and I only
just know what I've done. You agree not to hold me, nor Activision Blizzard liable for any damages caused by using these models.
