Map/Summary/LT00=Shortly after arriving to Chau Sara, the Lieutenant successfully completed a training exercise before being promptly deployed in order to aid the local Magistrate.
Map/Summary/LT01=The rebel insurgents known as the Sons of Korhal had established an encampment in the planet, the Lieutenant was tasked to raze it to the ground and take no prisoners.<n/><n/>However the mysterious group known as the Cerberus Recon Squad reassigned them in order to deal with a mysterious Xenomorph threat on the planet.
Map/Summary/LT02=Alpha Squadron and the Cerberus Recon Squad fought through the Xenomorph infestation to reach the Flannum Instillation. But the dark corners of the facility writhe with the nightmarish aliens...
Map/Summary/LT03=The surviving scientists have been evacuated from the Flannum Instillation. However, across the surface of Chau Sara, the Xenomorph situation continues to escalate as more of their hives infest the surface.
Map/Summary/LT04=With the aid of General Duke, Alpha Squadron wiped out the Xenomorph presence in Los Andres. Now Alpha Squadron and the Cerberus Recon Unit consolidate their final plans to pacify the threat to Chau Sara once and for all.
Map/Summary/LT05=The Xenomorph presence has been culled, and all information on the conflict has been placed under a Class-7 seal. The Confederacy locked down all traffic and communication out of Chau Sara, while UNN covered the operation as a daring police action against the Sons of Korhal.<n/><n/>As the Confederacy silently reveled in their victory, few saw this conflict as but the looming shadow of the coming war, and of the decade of bloodshed that would soon follow.
