Skin/Info/Adept=Highly trained battlefield commanders, adepts utilize Purifier technology to amplify their psionic potential. They are capable of projecting shades of themselves and teleporting across great distances.
Skin/Info/AdeptCE=The Daelaam's starforges may be capable of reconstructing the Purifier ordnance from Glacius, but they have yet to match the optimal performance of Karax's original prototypes.
Skin/Info/AdeptGolden=Nostalgic sentiment has been growing among the templar after the End War. Some adepts show their pride by wearing formal ceremonial armor from bygone days.
Skin/Info/AdeptIhanrii=Even battle-hardened Ihan-rii adepts needed time to get their bearings after a distress signal woke them from deep stasis on the fringes of the Koprulu Sector.
Skin/Info/AdeptPurifier=Refined by Phase-smith Karax, these AI warriors have become central figures in Purifier armies, impressing all who see them with their agility and refinement.
Skin/Info/AdeptTaldarim=Despite its recent development, the psionic amplification technology used by the Daelaam's adepts has already been reverse engineered by the Tal'darim and equipped on their most promising warriors.
Skin/Info/Archon=Archons boast overwhelming psionic power, but it comes at a high cost. Two templar must sacrifice themselves for an archon to be formed, making each one an embodiment of unparalleled heroism.
Skin/Info/Armory=The armory is built around several turbines. These keep the building within temperature specifications while researchers work tirelessly to improve terran war machinery.
Skin/Info/ArmoryCovertOps=The Dominion's latest advances in neosteel armor were developed through the molecular examination of xel'naga constructs recovered by special forces teams.
Skin/Info/ArmorySilver=Reports of protoss wandering into Tyrador IX's armories led to accusations of espionage, though Ihan-rii leadership insisted that these incidents were the result of settlers mistaking the gleaming structures for terran museums.
Skin/Info/Assimilator=Even the highly advanced protoss appreciate the myriad applications of vespene gas. They developed assimilators to harvest this useful resource.
Skin/Info/AssimilatorForged=Tal'darim assimilators greedily wrench vespene gas from the ground, triggering earthquakes that decimate surrounding ecosystems.
Skin/Info/AssimilatorIhanrii=The Ihan-rii protoss consider themselves very generous for allowing terrans to continue living on, let alone mining vespene gas from, their ancient and sacred homeworld, which they call Arakyr.
Skin/Info/AssimilatorTaldarim=[ph] AssimilatorTaldarim info
Skin/Info/Baneling=First observed during the Siege of Cask, the baneling is a highly volatile and explosive combat strain evolved from the zergling. Few materials can resist the acidic burst released upon their detonation.
Skin/Info/BanelingMecha=The recreation of the baneling posed a unique problem for engineers, as their carefully harvested acid sacs kept melting through the surrounding plate infrastructure. Eventually, they made it work.
Skin/Info/BanelingNest=The zerg hive cluster must have a baneling nest to add the baneling breed's genetic code. Once a nest is in place, any zergling on the field can be commanded to form a fleshy chrysalis for a brief pupation state, and then it will burst forth as a baneling--a foul, bloated creature with bulbous, acid-filled green sacs pulsating on its back.
Skin/Info/BanelingNestMecha=The upper half of the Simulant baneling nest is held aloft by the same antigravity technology deployed in terran battlecruisers.
Skin/Info/BanelingNestRCZ=To trigger the collapse of key terran fortifications, Cerberus baneling nests have been rigged to detonate in cave networks across Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/BanelingPrimal=Inspired by the banelings in Kerrigan's Swarm, Dehaka has encouraged the mutation of a similar strain of creatures within his pack.
Skin/Info/BanelingRCZ=The return on investment for replacing a baneling's entire nervous system, only to have it immediately blow up, is dubious. Luckily, Cerberus's clients have quite a lot of money to spend.
Skin/Info/BanelingWebby=The spine-like growths of Leviathan Brood zerglings remain present on the acid sacs of their banelings. Even a total metamorphosis is incapable of changing the chaotic nature of their core essence.
Skin/Info/Banshee=Procyon Industries designed banshees to be both economical and effective. Built specifically to provide air support for frontline infantry, they are ideal aircraft for tactical strikes.
Skin/Info/BansheeCovertOps=Dominion engineers have made critical upgrades in the banshee's twin VTOL turbofans, enabling superior stability and performance when paired with the new vertical stabilizer in the rear of the craft.
Skin/Info/BansheeJunker=Mercenaries are infamous for cobbling together pieces of equipment on their machinery, and these banshees are no exception. Rumor has it that some bulldozer parts are involved in this particular design.
Skin/Info/BansheeSilver=Though most Tyrador banshees were wiped out in the first wave of the Cerberus zerg attack, one seasoned pilot managed to take down three ultralisks first.
Skin/Info/BansheeUmojan=Through a series of backdoor deals, the Umojan Protectorate has been able to acquire a limited number of banshees from Procyon Industries, although the company maintains that they were stolen.
Skin/Info/Barracks=A home-away-from-home for terran infantry personnel, terran barracks are sterile, mobile, and capable of efficient deployment.
Skin/Info/BarracksCovertOps=A liquid nitrogen cooling system gives the special forces barracks an eerie blue glow.
Skin/Info/BarracksSilver=Each Knights of Tyrador barracks features a five-star robotic kitchen and a full-service spa--for officers only, of course.
Skin/Info/Battlecruiser=Battlecruisers often serve as mobile command headquarters during extended military campaigns. They are flying fortresses outfitted with heavy armor and imposing weaponry.
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserCovertOps=After a lengthy research and development process, the newly upgraded Moirai class battlecruisers were approved for exclusive use by Dominion Special Forces.
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserJunker=These ferocious vessels have been modified to suit the mercenaries' preferences. However, few onlookers live long enough to admire their handiwork.
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserRemastered=The command decks of Brood War-era battlecruisers had a lower profile, with port and starboard viewdecks to ensure maximum visibility in the event of a zerg ambush.
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserSilver=Assailed by Cerberus zerg, the Knights of Tyrador dispatched a Behemoth-class battlecruiser to request aid from the stone ships waiting in silent orbit.
Skin/Info/BattlecruiserUmojan=Umojan battlecruisers feature redesigned neosteel plating, as well as refinements to the Yamato cannons that make them particularly distinctive in battles.
Skin/Info/BroodLord=Evolved to rule the skies, the brood lords are terrifying creatures that hurl their destructive broodlings at enemy forces.
Skin/Info/BroodLordMecha=Upon completing the brood lord prototype which exceeded all standards, the team of Project Simulant scientists were sent on leave for a celebratory vacation. Strangely, they never returned...
Skin/Info/BroodLordPrimal=A small number of brood lords have been integrated into primal zerg packs, resulting in a strikingly different creature most notable for its unusual claws.
Skin/Info/BroodLordRCZ=Each broodling dispatched from the Cerberus brood lord can be controlled individually by a commander safe at a computer console, far away from the actual battle.
Skin/Info/BroodLordWebby=Despite their late introduction into the Swarm, many brood lords still bear the Leviathan Brood's signature genetic traits--likely a sign of early essence experimentation by the evolution master, Abathur.
Skin/Info/BroodLord_PremiumSkin_Aquatic=While infesting a planet with exceptionally large seas, some brood lords took to the water and evolved the ability to dive deep into the trenches while devouring their prey.
Skin/Info/Bunker=Due to its ubiquity and lack of amenities, terran infantry commonly refer to bunkers as "battlefield coffins."
Skin/Info/BunkerCovertOps=The next-generation Dominion bunker can withstand the full weight of an ultralisk, but what most marines are excited about is the fact that it comes with chairs.
Skin/Info/BunkerSilver=Tyrador's supercooled bunkers make for comfortable reconnaissance, even in sweltering tropical vacation zones.
Skin/Info/Carrier=These magnificent capital ships are known to inspire hope in the hearts of the templar--or fear in their enemies. Armed with swift interceptors, they are a formidable force on the battlefield.
Skin/Info/CarrierGolden=A small number of carriers have been rebuilt using ancient techniques to better resemble their counterparts from the period after the Aeon of Strife. They are primarily used for diplomatic visits.
Skin/Info/CarrierIhanrii=The animated stone developed by the Ihan-rii protoss is light, durable, and chemically inert, making it the perfect material for massive deep-space ships.
Skin/Info/CarrierPurifier=The Purifier carrier is a streamlined creation that perfectly combines automation expertise with the deadliest of drone weapons.
Skin/Info/CarrierRemastered=Carriers modeled after legendary flagship Gantrithor continue to be built in certain corners of Protoss space, to honor Tassadar and the sacrifice he made.
Skin/Info/CarrierTaldarim=Tal'darim shipwrights excel at repurposing khalai engineering for bloodshed. The carriers that make up the majority of the death fleet are warships through and through.
Skin/Info/Carrier_AmonBrood_Collection=Amon corrupted a large portion of the Golden Armada, using their warriors as his own. These possessed protoss took on a different appearance due to the Void energy, and their ships were likewise changed.
Skin/Info/Colossus=Colossi were the first protoss robots designed solely for destruction. They are both a symbol of a bloody history and a necessary weapon to secure a peaceful future.
Skin/Info/ColossusCE=Deemed too dangerous for use after the Kalath Intercession, the Purifier program's colossi are legendary among the Templar's warriors. These are the ultimate purification machines.
Skin/Info/ColossusGolden=Selected colossi that saw combat in the End War have been remodeled in a traditionalist style using the finest materials available. They now resemble the grandest of ancient protoss robotics.
Skin/Info/ColossusIhanrii=The many stone components of the Ihan-rii colossus are levitated and held together by void energies emanated from repurposed xel'naga dynamos.
Skin/Info/ColossusPurifier=The latest in Purifier engineering has yielded a sleek, subtly enhanced colossus that is nonetheless a brutal war machine.
Skin/Info/ColossusTal=Relics of wars long over, colossi that lay buried and forgotten across the sector are often unearthed and reactivated by Tal'darim ascendants who seek superior firepower.
Skin/Info/ColossusTaldarim=Lower ranking ascendants often dare each other to disable and commandeer an active colossus. If one succeeds, the Tal'darim gain a powerful war machine. If not, a rival ascendant has been eliminated.
Skin/Info/CommandCenter=Mobile and practical, command centers are resource processors that can relocate to wherever minerals or vespene gas are plentiful.
Skin/Info/CommandCenterCovertOps=Reinforced repulsor landing claws help this command center find solid footing in even the harshest environments.
Skin/Info/CommandCenterRemastered=Previous iterations of the command center had an extensible interface in order to connect with external add-ons. These were later replaced with internal bays for increased security.
Skin/Info/CommandCenterSilver=After the arrival of the Ihan-rii protoss, Tyrador's command centers played host to diplomatic envoys from around the Koprulu Sector, each intent on recruiting the newcomers to their own specific political agenda.
Skin/Info/Corruptor=Held aloft by a biologically produced electromagnetic field, corruptors can spray a stream of caustic acid that eats through even the most durable of construction materials.
Skin/Info/CorruptorMecha=Rather than spores, these mechanical corruptors possess self-replicating nanites that have been programmed to perform the same function, disturbingly enough.
Skin/Info/CorruptorPrimal=The original corruptors have the distinction of being adapted by both the Swarm and the primal zerg. The latter have adapted thicker claws and carapaces to assist with their rigorous feeding process.
Skin/Info/CorruptorRCZ=Driven underground after the fall of Arcturus Mengsk, the Cerberus Program evolved their neural reprogramming initiative, targeting zerg instead of terran soldiers.
Skin/Info/CorruptorWebby=While hardened spines and webbed features often suggest an aquatic background, the Leviathan Brood's corruptors adapted them to survive in high gravity environments.
Skin/Info/CreepTumorMecha=Sophisticated nanotechnology must lie at the heart of creep tumors created by rogue Simulant queens, though further investigation has been stymied by the tumors' tendency to detonate when cut open.
Skin/Info/CyberneticsCore=The protoss are known to pair elite fallen warriors with artificial bodies, granting them a second life in glorious combat. The cybernetics core plays a large role in developing this technology.
Skin/Info/CyberneticsCoreForged=All cybernetics cores possess the ability to bind biological beings to elaborate machinery; in Tal'darim cybernetics cores, the main difference is that the process is unimaginably painful.
Skin/Info/CyberneticsCoreIhanrii=Terran recon of Ihan-rii settlements yielded footage of a structure resembling the contemporary protoss cybernetics core, though the energies produced by the Ihan-rii version were wildly different.
Skin/Info/Cyclone=Originally intended to be fully automated, this mobile assault vehicle was redesigned to accommodate a pilot. After all, nothing can match the unpredictability of a human driver.
Skin/Info/CycloneCovertOps=This vehicle has undergone extensive redesigns to increase its maneuverability in special forces missions, including exposed treads that will cross difficult terran and small spaces more readily.
Skin/Info/CycloneJunker=Mira's mercs have significantly bulked up their cyclones, adding extra plating and a generous number of spikes. However, due to their hasty engineering, its ability to absorb damage remains the same.
Skin/Info/CycloneSilver=When the Cerberus zerg attacked Tyrador IX, a few cyclones sent to defend were still armed with harmless fireworks used for nightly amusement park displays.
Skin/Info/CycloneUmojan=If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then these cyclones are the Umojan engineers' elaborate tribute to the ingenuity of the Terran Dominion.
Skin/Info/DarkShrine=The dark shrine once stood as a monument to the independent society of the Nerazim. After the rejoining the khalai, the Nerazim repurposed it as a training ground for dark templar.
Skin/Info/DarkShrineForged=None but the blood hunters, enforcers of the Highlords' malevolent will, know what transpires within the Tal'darim dark shrine.
Skin/Info/DarkShrineIhanrii=The superheated fumes venting from the top of the Ihan-rii dark shrine suggest infernal internal temperatures, though terran thermal analysis indicates the animated stone exterior is near-freezing.
Skin/Info/DarkTemplar=Powerful psionic warriors of the Nerazim, dark templar have learned how to manipulate the powers of the Void. They strike from the shadows, deadly and relentless.
Skin/Info/DarkTemplarGolden=Templar traditionalists claim to have befriended a few of the Nerazim, boasting that these individuals are the true symbol of the Daelaam. Others say they were merely bribed.
Skin/Info/DarkTemplarIhanrii=Early in their training, Ihan-rii protoss are bound to a void crystal that resonates with their unique psionic signature. Once they reach adulthood, this crystal is sharpened into a deadly spearpoint.
Skin/Info/DarkTemplarPurifier=After increased interaction with the Nerazim, the Purifiers have designed a new variant on the sentinel that mimics the combat prowess of Dark Templar warriors.
Skin/Info/DarkTemplarTaldarim=Tal'darim society is brutal and unforgiving. Those deemed too weak to be of service to their Highlord are ruthlessly hunted down and executed by the blood hunters, who stalk their prey unseen.
Skin/Info/Disruptor=Originally developed as part of the Purifier program, disruptors are among the deadliest of protoss armaments. Their solarite arsenal is capable of immense devastation.
Skin/Info/DisruptorGolden=Much like the colossi, disruptors that saw combat in the End War have been refurbished as reminders of the protoss' moments of victory. Perhaps with time, the memories of their losses will fade.
Skin/Info/DisruptorIhanrii=Ihan-rii disruptors draw crackling green energy directly from the crystal cores of their capital ships. Anything biological that makes contact with the central power conduit is promptly vaporized.
Skin/Info/DisruptorPurifier=The latest disruptors from Cybros feature advanced plating and protocol refinements that reflect their investment in ongoing research.
Skin/Info/DisruptorTaldarim=The Tal'darim often scoff at the Daelaam's choice of weaponry, but they were quick to seize and repurpose as many disruptors as they could. Such destructive power is too great to ignore.
Skin/Info/Drone=Single-minded and diligent, drones hold within their genetic code the evolutionary potential of all zerg structures. All they require are resources and creep to nourish their added biomass.
Skin/Info/DroneBlizzcon17=This unusual drone hatched amid a pile of rusting terran wreckage. Rather than suffering from the interference, its flesh adapted to fuse itself to the rubble.
Skin/Info/DroneMecha=The Simulant Project began with the construction of a mechanical drone that could be used during target practice to test alternate combat techniques and weapons, but it soon grew much larger.
Skin/Info/DronePrimal=Primal drones often find themselves in a perilous position, as stronger members of their packs have been known to feed on them when they require additional nourishment.
Skin/Info/DroneRCZ=Like the rest of the Cerberus zerg, this drone's nervous system has been replaced with cybernetic technology, enabling full musculoskeletal control.
Skin/Info/DroneRemastered=Earlier evolutions of the drone had more vibrant coloration and increased aggression reflexes that gradually disappeared within the population in the following years.
Skin/Info/DroneWebby=Poisonous fin rays are a universal defense mechanism signaling predators to stay away. Some creatures merely mimic their deadly appearance to discourage unwanted aggression.
Skin/Info/EngineeringBay=The terrans heavily developed their engineering capabilities after the Brood War. Due to the increase in personnel and the intricacy of their work, the engineering bay is no longer cleared for flight.
Skin/Info/EngineeringBayCovertOps=Experimental engineering bays increase research speed by pitting rival AIs against one another in simulated battle.
Skin/Info/EngineeringBaySilver=A portion of each Knights of Tyrador engineering bay is devoted to concocting new amusement park attractions, though this policy has been temporarily suspended in wake of the Cerberus zerg assault.
Skin/Info/EvolutionChamber=Genetic sequences twist and merge within the evolution chamber, generating improvements to the zerg army. 
Skin/Info/EvolutionChamberMecha=Like other Simulant structures, the evolution chamber is constructed from a polymeric alloy capable of flexing to accommodate the roiling biomechanical processes within.
Skin/Info/EvolutionChamberRCZ=After months of frustration in the Cerberus bioengineering department, it was discovered that pumping an evolution chamber's arteries full of command pheromones could just about tame the structure's hyperadaptive tendencies.
Skin/Info/Extractor=This is a biological structure that digests vespene gas before excreting it in small flesh sacs. These sacs are perfectly designed to be easily transportable by a drone.
Skin/Info/ExtractorMecha=Planning documents indicate that the Simulant Project's extractors were intended to be purely decorative. It remains unclear when they shifted into full vespene production.
Skin/Info/ExtractorRCZ=Cerberus extractors pulse unremittingly beneath Tyrador IX's surface, leeching every trace of vespene gas from the planet's crust to power further expansion.
Skin/Info/Factory=During the Second Great War, latrines were removed from factories. This extra space allowed mechanics to deploy siege tanks with siege capabilities already installed.
Skin/Info/FactoryCovertOps=The R36-series factory features sturdier anchors, a reinforced foundation, and bulletproof coat of paint.
Skin/Info/FactorySilver=Settlement negotiations between the Ihan-rii protoss and Tyrador IX's leaders hit a snag when several terran factories in a disputed area mysteriously exploded, leaving glowing green craters.
Skin/Info/FleetBeacon=Fleet beacons serve to strengthen the connection of any nearby stargate to the psionic matrix, enabling the warp transport of massive capital ships.
Skin/Info/FleetBeaconForged=The Tal'darim fleet beacon forces an almost certainly inadvisable amount of psionic energy through its central sphere, enabling the teleportation of massive and heavily armored warships.
Skin/Info/FleetBeaconIhanrii=Back on Arakyr at last, the Ihan-rii built powerful fleet beacons to scan the depths of space for other survivors of their ancient civilization.
Skin/Info/FleetBeaconTaldarim=[ph] FleetBeaconTaldarim info
Skin/Info/Forge=The forge houses phase-smiths working tirelessly to improve the weapons, armor, and ships of their brethren. These elite engineers will not rest until the day Aiur is reclaimed.
Skin/Info/ForgeForged=Inside Tal'darim forges, captured Khalai engineers are interrogated for their technological secrets.
Skin/Info/ForgeIhanrii=The Ihan-rii mine void crystals from veins along Arakyr's southern pole, storing them vacuum-sealed in their forges' deepest chambers.
Skin/Info/ForgeTaldarim=[ph] ForgeTaldarim info
Skin/Info/FusionCore=The work undertaken in the fusion core is extremely delicate. Researchers here harness antimatter and nuclear power to increase battlecruiser capability.
Skin/Info/FusionCoreCovertOps=To accommodate the new Moirai-class battlecruiser, the fusion core's energy output was quadrupled without increasing its heat signature.
Skin/Info/FusionCoreSilver=In addition to supporting the orbital battlecruiser fleet, liquid-cooled fusion cores provide most of the power for Tyrador IX's casinos, water parks, and robotic massage parlors.
Skin/Info/Gateway=Following the Brood War, the protoss reverse engineered the ancient warp technology of the xel'naga. Gateways can now transport warriors to distant battlefields within seconds.
Skin/Info/GatewayForged=The Tal'darim gateway can warp warriors from much further away than its Khalai counterparts. One downside of the additional power is that passengers are occasionally torn to bits en route.
Skin/Info/GatewayIhanrii=Interspecies relations on Tyrador IX faced their toughest test yet when a terran dignitary visiting an Ihan-rii settlement touched a gateway and was immediately (and messily) vaporized by excess void energies.
Skin/Info/GatewayTaldarim=[ph] GatewayTaldarim info
Skin/Info/Ghost=The ultimate terran covert operatives, ghosts harness their innate psionic potential to enhance their lethal skill sets. They are unrivaled in their ability to infiltrate and assassinate.
Skin/Info/GhostAcademy=After forming the Dominion, Mengsk sought to overhaul the ghost program. Dedicated ghost academies with attached nuclear silos were erected in order to fully harness this potential.
Skin/Info/GhostAcademyCovertOps=Newer ghost academies have ameliorated the issue of radiation leaking from nuclear silos into the neighboring training areas.
Skin/Info/GhostAcademySilver=When it was discovered that Cerberus was responsible for the invasion of remote-control zerg, the Knights of Tyrador recruited mercenary ghosts to track down and assassinate the rogue corporation's leadership.
Skin/Info/GhostCovertOps=Emperor Valerian has initiated various changes in the ghost program in recent years, resulting in better, more committed recruits who serve of their own free will.
Skin/Info/GhostEidolon=Few ghosts manage to survive the rigors of the program long enough to call themselves veterans, but those who do gain access to the highly exclusive Eidolon suits.
Skin/Info/GhostJunker=Despite her charismatic personality, Mira Han has had nothing but trouble recruiting and retaining ghosts among her crew. Perhaps they prefer more sophisticated weaponry than mercs can offer.
Skin/Info/GhostNova=All ghosts are deadly covert operatives, but those who graduate at the head of their class are the deadliest. These elite assassins are at the center of countless battlefield operations.
Skin/Info/GhostSilver=Elite ghosts guard Tyrador's most valuable tourists. Their visors were discontinued after a visiting rock star complained that "the masks freak me out, man."
Skin/Info/GhostUmojan=Known as shadowguards, these elite operatives are employed to keep the secrets of the Umojan Protectorate, as well as the peace.
Skin/Info/GreaterSpireMecha=Officially, the Simulant Project never completed a replica of the greater spire. Photographs suggesting the contrary have been dismissed as elaborate fakes by Dominion representatives.
Skin/Info/Hatchery=Every colony needs a heart. From digesting minerals to creating larva to generating creep, hatcheries hold the genetic blueprints for the zerg.
Skin/Info/HatcheryMecha=By the time the Simulant Project's replica hatcheries began mysteriously producing a substance indistinguishable from creep, the directors had bigger problems to worry about.
Skin/Info/HatcheryRCZ=After verifying that their infiltration of Tyrador IX's subterranean environment had escaped detection, Cerberus began seeding the planet's extensive lava tubes with remote-operated hatcheries.
Skin/Info/HatcheryRemastered=The zerg broodmothers vied for dominance over one another in the absence of the Queen of Blades. Many of those who were weak were displaced from their colonies and perished. Others discovered abandoned, dormant hatcheries and set to work raising new broods.
Skin/Info/Hellion=High-speed raiders with lightweight chassis, hellions excel at lightning-fast strike missions and evasive maneuvering. They are particularly popular with mercenary companies.
Skin/Info/HellionCovertOps=Refined to utilize a bold, three-wheel design, this hellion is sleeker and easier to steer than ever before. Word among the drivers is that it's even more fun, too.
Skin/Info/HellionJunker=Originally modified for underground demolition leagues, these Hellions have become the preferred vehicles of the fringe worlds' notorious junker gangs.
Skin/Info/HellionJunkerMM=These hellions were made to get their drivers out of bad situations quickly and look good in the process. They may also have illegal stim emitters, but the mercs are tight-lipped about them.
Skin/Info/HellionSilver=The stylish chrome rims on the Tyrador hellion were designed in collaboration with street racer-turned-fashion icon JJ Hyun.
Skin/Info/HellionUmojan=Umojans drive in style thanks to their sophisticated hellions, which sport improved suspension, defensive plating, and even more comfortable seats for their drivers.
Skin/Info/HighTemplar=The high templar are the most respected and experienced warriors of the protoss race. Having honed their psionic abilities to an awe-inspiring degree, their minds are their greatest weapon.
Skin/Info/HighTemplarGolden=The Shelak high templar were the first to wear ancient armor in recognition of Khas and his role in uniting the templar. By embracing the glorious past, they quiet their fears about the troubled future.
Skin/Info/HighTemplarIhanrii=Unable to reach the "Zeratul" whose distress signal had wrested them from deep stasis, the Ihan-rii protoss made their way to the system that, long ago, they had called home.
Skin/Info/HighTemplarPurifier=After extensive experimentation, the Purifiers have perfected AI warriors that possess the same distinctive abilities as the high templar in the Daelaam. Hierarch Artanis himself is said to be impressed.
Skin/Info/HighTemplarTaldarim=Through Rak'Shir, the Tal'darim climb the Chain of Ascension. Years of absorbing terrazine and the essence of their supplicants have made these ascendants powerful indeed.
Skin/Info/HiveMecha=The further mutation of several Simulant Project lairs into full-blown hives would probably have triggered a fastidious investigation if anybody had still been around to perform one.
Skin/Info/Hydralisk=Evolved to be nightmarish killers, hydralisks boast robust musculature that allows them to eject the spines between their carapace plating with such speed that they can puncture neosteel.
Skin/Info/HydraliskDen=The zerg took the structure of the peaceful slothien and evolved it to create the hydralisk den. Over time, it has developed a biological exoskeleton to protect its flesh.
Skin/Info/HydraliskDenMecha=Investigators were never able to ascertain the purpose of the deadly vanadium blades sprouting from the hydralisk den, nor the individual responsible for placing them there.
Skin/Info/HydraliskDenRCZ=Abandoning the invasion of Tyrador IX was never an option for Cerberus, which needs to demonstrate metrics like "+20% hydralisk production efficiency in real-world scenarios" to earn out its funding agreements.
Skin/Info/HydraliskMecha=Simulant hydralisks posed a significant risk to their creators, who chose to replace their claws with blades that could be easily dulled during the assembly process.
Skin/Info/HydraliskNoxious=Though the noxious strain of zerg first emerged in ultralisks, it has since spread to include hydralisks as well. These specimens have inherited the strain's signature toxic characteristics, along with a more ferocious appearance.
Skin/Info/HydraliskPrimal=Swarm hydralisks were quickly integrated into primal zerg packs, where they kept many of their original traits. Clearly this is a testament to their evolutionary strength.
Skin/Info/HydraliskRCZ=Cerberus hydralisks penetrated New Canaan's defense perimeter during a dust storm, when their luminescent eyes were mistaken for dune buggy headlights.
Skin/Info/HydraliskRemastered=Earlier Hydralisk evolutions were characterized by slimmer spikes and an imposing, colorful crest.
Skin/Info/HydraliskWebby=Hydralisks of the Leviathan Brood never lost the genetic sequences necessary to metamorphize into lurkers. Indeed, elements of the lurkers' appearance are woven directly into their DNA.
Skin/Info/Immortal=When revered protoss heroes fall, their remains are transplanted into robotic exoskeletons. These heavily armed and shielded immortals are among the most loyal of warriors.
Skin/Info/ImmortalAdun=To the protoss, there is no greater honor than self-sacrifice. Adun understood this most of all, and it is in his name that the immortals are consecrated.
Skin/Info/ImmortalGolden=After the End War, some fallen templar elected to be placed into ancient immortal exoskeletons to show their dedication to the ideals that united the protoss in times of trouble.
Skin/Info/ImmortalIhanrii=Ihan-rii heroes who die honorably are interred in four-legged robotic sarcophagi, which carry their remains to future battles, armed with tremendous cannons.
Skin/Info/ImmortalPurifier=In the aftermath of the End War, the Purifiers have been able to repurpose the shells of deceased immortals so they can continue functioning as purely robotic fighters.
Skin/Info/ImmortalTaldarim=Encased within armored assault frames, Tal'darim warriors who are felled in failure and disgrace seek the opportunity to erase their shame. Their hope is to die well in service of their Highlord.
Skin/Info/InfestationPit=The infestation pit is where genetics run wild, cultivating a vast array of diseases, plague cells, and neural parasites. Only the most efficient of these maladies are utilized by infestors. 
Skin/Info/InfestationPitMecha=The first suggestion of a Simulant Project AI malfunction came when the infestor den stopped responding to its maintenance technicians.
Skin/Info/InfestationPitRCZ=Neural parasites from judiciously distributed infestation pits ensure that any adventurous spelunkers who happen across Cerberus-occupied lava tubes report technical difficulties, then are never heard from again.
Skin/Info/Infestor=True to their name, infestors spread the Swarm's influence wherever they go. Organisms that are injected with an infestor's neural parasites become the zerg's mindless soldiers.
Skin/Info/InfestorMecha=Researchers failed to create an AI that replicated the infestors' neural parasites. They were removing the infestors from production when, unexpectedly, the parasites' AI began functioning perfectly...
Skin/Info/InfestorPrimal=As frequent targets of larger, more vicious competitors within their pack, primal infestors have evolved thickened plating along their back to protect themselves.
Skin/Info/InfestorRCZ=In response to feedback from an important corporate client, Cerberus implanted the notoriously fragile infestor with supportive titanium infrastructure.
Skin/Info/InfestorWebby=As a colony creature, the organisms comprising the borboru matriarch took many different functions. Within Leviathan infestors, the defensive structures of the base creature are more pronounced.
Skin/Info/LairMecha=When the first Simulant Project hatchery mutated into a lair, an internal audit was launched, though the engineer responsible was never discovered.
Skin/Info/Larva=This unassuming, maggot-like organism is covered in an deceptively strong hide and capable of mutating into any number of horrors.
Skin/Info/LarvaMecha=Visual recognition among Simulants is a common justification for creating mecha larvae that resemble their inspirations in silhouette and gait. This doesn't entirely explain why Simulant Project engineers felt it necessary to replicate the zerg larva's signature squelching noises.
Skin/Info/LarvaRCZ=Cerberus invested a great deal of effort in mapping unique and often painful stimuli to the metamorphoses of the zerg larva in which they resulted.
Skin/Info/Liberator=Inspired by the UED’s valkyries, liberators were originally designed to combat aerial threats. The addition of air-to-ground artillery allows them to also deal with terrestrial enemy forces.
Skin/Info/LiberatorCovertOps=Recent improvements in neosteel construction have led to more complex plating designs that augment the liberator's transformation process, making it the envy of the Dominion fleet.
Skin/Info/LiberatorJunker=Mira Han won all of her liberators in just one incredibly dramatic poker game. Unfortunately, she lost them all to a rival mercenary just a short time later.
Skin/Info/LiberatorSilver=Liberators on Tyrador IX are equipped with numerous front-facing floodlights, increasing visibility during late-night patrols of the planet's stunning wilderness.
Skin/Info/LiberatorUmojan=It only took a few years for the Umojan Protectorate to unleash its version of the famous Liberator. Its wholly re-imagined rear thrusters have become the envy of the Terran Dominion engineering team.
Skin/Info/Lurker=The lurker was believed lost until its sequences were recovered from a feral hive cluster. Now, the lurkers serve the Swarm once again, annihilating their foes from the darkness below.
Skin/Info/LurkerDen=From a distance, the lurker den appears to be more bone than flesh. Upon closer inspection, the exterior is more like a grooved, thick leather.
Skin/Info/LurkerDenMecha=The process of forging nano-tipped lurker spines generates tremendous heat, which the Simulant lurker den dissipates through a convoluted network of vents and cooling fins.
Skin/Info/LurkerDenRCZ=Anticipating the need for advance lookouts and a stealthy first line of defense, Cerberus produced an abundance of lurker dens to support their infestation of Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/LurkerMecha=Extensive subterranean tests yielded a capable mechanized lurker, aside from its spikes, which were reshaped to better perform under blunt force impact.
Skin/Info/LurkerPrimal=Some of the primal hydralisks developed mutations that led them to exhibit an increasing number of lurker characteristics. At this point, they resemble lurkers more than their hydralisk ancestors.
Skin/Info/LurkerRCZ=A company of Ihan-rii protoss dispatched to investigate the surface of Tyrador IX were  massacred by Cerberus lurkers that happened to be burrowed at the landing site.
Skin/Info/LurkerWebby=The innate connection between hydralisks and lurkers within the Leviathan Brood is unparalleled among the Swarm. As such, their metamorphosis yields a considerable number of additional seismic spines.
Skin/Info/Marauder=Marauders are walking tanks, designed by the Dominion to combat the hardened carapaces of the zerg. Their grenades are effective against a variety of other targets, as well.
Skin/Info/MarauderCovertOps=When the Dominion Special Forces surveyed their personnel for improvements on marauder suits, only one dominated the conversation--bigger guns. The weapons researchers gladly obliged.
Skin/Info/MarauderDeluxe=Recent improvements to the CMC-660 Heavy Combat Suit have been approved for voluntary field testing. Luckily, there are plenty of marauders in the corps who could use the credits.
Skin/Info/MarauderJunker=As some of the original members of Mira Han's crew, these marauders are unusually loyal compared to others in the mercenary world... or Han just has exceptionally compelling blackmail on them.
Skin/Info/MarauderSilver=The Tyrador marauder weighs almost twice the Dominion standard. Engineers compensated for the extra density with enhanced hydraulics and exhaust.
Skin/Info/MarauderUmojan=Special advancements in CMC armor have given these marauders improved night vision options, as well as a heavily reinforced upper frame to support their weightier grenade launchers.
Skin/Info/Marine=Marines are the first line of defense for terran worlds across the sector. Comprised of convicts, rebels and patriots alike, they're always ready for a fight.
Skin/Info/MarineCovertOps=One's service in the Dominion Special Forces may not always last long, but all marines can agree that there's never a dull moment on the job.
Skin/Info/MarineJunker=Those who ask why these mercenaries carry bladed weapons have clearly never been in a backwater bar fight with them.
Skin/Info/MarineRemastered=Marines who fought in the Brood War often express nostalgia for the armor they wore back then, which they claim was significantly more comfortable.
Skin/Info/MarineSilver=The mercenary marines who guard Tyrador's resorts and beaches are mostly grizzled veterans lured to the system by the promise of an easy gig and generous pay.
Skin/Info/MarineUmojan=Umojan marines have recently seen exciting armor upgrades—officially to increase the safety and average deployment time of recruits, but possibly as preparation for a future conflict.
Skin/Info/MarineXPR=Despite their reputation as heavy drinkers and barroom brawlers, the War Pigs are some of the most dependable mercenaries in the sector.
Skin/Info/Medivac=Functioning as both a dropship and a medical bay, medivacs allow for simultaneous troop deployment and triage, reducing the time required to redeploy wounded soldiers.
Skin/Info/MedivacCovertOps=In response to considerable losses on a recent covert ops mission, the Dominion leadership has approved the use of medivacs on a greater number of assignments, with the goal of reducing casualties.
Skin/Info/MedivacJunker=Though mercenaries are used to taking their chances in battle, occasionally their missions involve important enough personnel to merit the use of one of these customized medivacs.
Skin/Info/MedivacSilver=Though staffed by experienced pilots, medivacs on Tyrador IX are mostly used to rescue wealthy tourists who wreck their luxury yachts on reefs in the emerald seas.
Skin/Info/MedivacUmojan=The extensive medical training of medivac pilots has been credited for the longer than average soldier lifespan in the Umojan Protectorate.
Skin/Info/MissileTurret=Although these defensive structures are prone to breaking down, they effectively target aerial attackers and are capable of detecting hidden foes.
Skin/Info/MissileTurretCovertOps=Thanks to their sleek, low-profile design, special forces missile turrets often remain undetected until enemy ships are directly within their line of fire.
Skin/Info/MissileTurretSilver=Though the Ihan-rii claim their fast-growing void ray fleet is intended for ceremonial purposes only, the Knights of Tyrador have begun a massive expansion of their missile turret network just in case.
Skin/Info/Mothership=The ultimate protoss vessel, Motherships serve as star-faring command centers that can single-handedly decide the outcome of a battle. They are the flagships of the Golden Armada.
Skin/Info/MothershipGolden=Though motherships have always been well-maintained, the revival of interest in the golden age of the Templar has resulted in a new wave of support and care for the priceless vessels.
Skin/Info/MothershipIhanrii=The Ihan-rii protoss believe themselves to be the only true descendants of the xel'naga, a message they convey proudly in the runes that adorn their motherships.
Skin/Info/MothershipPurifier=In the interest of presenting themselves as equals to the templar, the Purifiers have begun constructing their own massive motherships.
Skin/Info/MothershipTaldarim=The death fleet's motherships are equipped for total battlefield domination. Each one is a throne from which a Tal'darim fleet lord oversees the ruin of their foes.
Skin/Info/Mutalisk=Few things are as terrifying as a sky blotted out by the wings of mutalisks. The glave wurm symbiotes they expel can easily ravage entire armies from above.
Skin/Info/MutaliskMecha=Though the mutalisk struggled with initial weight tests, its eventual success led to many new investors for the Simulant Project--some of them with ulterior motivations.
Skin/Info/MutaliskPrimal=The primal mutalisks are everchanging, particularly when it comes to their wings and tails. This strain also features subdued coloring, allowing them to conceal themselves in many different environments.
Skin/Info/MutaliskRCZ=Swarms of Cerberus mutalisks outmaneuvered the inexperienced viking pilots defending Tyrador IX, but they faced a tougher foe when the Ihan-rii protoss descended in ancient stone ships.
Skin/Info/MutaliskWebby=Mutalisks comprise a vast number of the Leviathan Brood's forces. It is said that they function as one mind in battle, a singular unyielding mass that blacks out the sky.
Skin/Info/Nexus=The nexus acts as an anchor allowing protoss to access the psionic matrix across the galaxy. Recent technological advancements have enabled these focal points to manipulate space and time itself.
Skin/Info/NexusForged=Long ago, the Tal'darim adapted a captured Khalai nexus to maximize its architectural brutality, with a supercharged khaydarin crystal restrained by psionic prongs at its peak.
Skin/Info/NexusIhanrii=The Ihan-rii welcome terran delegations into their settlements, but never inside their imposing stone nexuses, from which strange ululations and distant heartbeat-sounds emanate.
Skin/Info/NexusRemastered=Following the Brood War, the Daelaam dedicated a great many phase-smiths to retrofit older nexuses with the latest chronal distortion technology.
Skin/Info/NydusNetwork=Nydus networks evolved from a combination of nydus canals and the desire of broodmothers to surprise and swarm. When activated by chemical stimuli, nydus networks form tunnels underground across the battlefield.
Skin/Info/NydusNetworkMecha=A scanner sweep conducted after the dissolution of the Simulant Project revealed a convoluted network of unauthorized nydus tunnels honeycombing the facility.
Skin/Info/NydusNetworkRCZ=Remote-operated nydus networks ensure that the second invasion of Tyrador IX will come from everywhere at once, hopefully facilitating an outcome more palatable to the Cerberus executive board.
Skin/Info/NydusWormMecha=Though the Simulant Project nydus worm lacks the original's musculoskeletal indestructibility, it smells a whole lot better inside.
Skin/Info/Observer=Complex sensor matrices allow observers to collect massive amounts of data in a short amount of time. The critical intelligence they provide has turned the tide of battle time and again.
Skin/Info/ObserverGolden=Older observers had a different stabilizer configuration that, though equally effective, gave them with a more imposing aspect. Some phase-smiths claim that it also boosts performance, but this is unverified.
Skin/Info/ObserverIhanrii=For millennia, the Ihan-rii have deployed observers to monitor the other protoss sects and the zerg without concern of being discovered.
Skin/Info/ObserverPurifier=Observers are greatly prized among the Purifier forces, having found especially strong favor with Fenix himself.
Skin/Info/ObserverTaldarim=Reconnaissance is essential for effective deception and subterfuge. The most cunning ascendants make extensive use of observers to spy on Slayn's enemies... and on each other.
Skin/Info/Oracle=During their long exile from Aiur, the Nerazim were free to experiment with new technologies. The agile oracle vessels are an excellent example of how fruitful this exploration could be.
Skin/Info/OracleGolden=Templar traditionalists still borrow technology from the Nerazim, choosing to change only the aesthetics to suit their preferences. Matriarch Vorazun has declined to comment on this practice.
Skin/Info/OracleIhanrii=The Ihan-rii dispatched oracles to investigate the Behemoth-class battlecruiser that approached them in orbit around Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/OraclePurifier=Though initially beset by design challenges, clever phase-smiths have been able to engineer vessels similar to the Nerazim oracles.
Skin/Info/OracleTaldarim=The Tal'darim have long coveted the Nerazim's temporal mastery. Stolen oracles are jealously guarded by the fleet lords who control them.
Skin/Info/OrbitalCommandCovertOps=The cutting-edge scanners on this orbital command render most reconnaissance missions unnecessary – much to the relief of the low-ranking marines usually tasked with locating the enemy.
Skin/Info/OverSeerWebby=Bred to specialize in reconnaissance, the fins and tendrils of the Leviathan overseers allow them to cut through both air and water with minimal effort.
Skin/Info/Overlord=Overlords perform a critical function for a zerg hive cluster-- spreading creep and relaying psionic commands from a broodmother to the less evolved organisms she controls.
Skin/Info/OverlordMecha=An early creation during the course of the Simulant Project, the overlord is carefully controlled by a lab scientist, making it a critical safety point in the entire operation.
Skin/Info/OverlordPrimal=Some primal zerg pack leaders, like Dehaka, have evolved beyond the need of overlords, but a few of them nonetheless remain as vestiges of the past.
Skin/Info/OverlordRCZ=Cerberus overlords use incandescent energy beacons to pinpoint positioning even in low-visibility conditions, like the dust storms and fog banks common on Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/OverlordWebby=Overlords exert control over the minions of the zerg. As a result of their constant connection, the Leviathan Brood's overlords reflect the genetic mutations of the creatures beneath them.
Skin/Info/OverlordXPR=Due to their need to support many different strains of zerg at once, overlords can sometimes exhibit spontaneous adaptive mutations in an attempt to improve their own efficiency.
Skin/Info/Overseer=Evolved from the overlord, the overseer focuses its eyes towards scouting and revealing the presence of hidden enemies, wherever they may lurk.
Skin/Info/OverseerMecha=Unable to fully replicate the organic structure behind the overseer's eyes, the head engineer replaced them with detection sensors that fulfill largely the same purpose—aside from the aesthetics.
Skin/Info/OverseerPrimal=One of the rarest species of primal zerg, the overseers are seldom seen. Like their Swarm counterparts, they evolved from primal overlords and possess especially keen senses.
Skin/Info/OverseerRCZ=The Cerberus overseer's void sensor technology was developed by one Dr. Rudolfo Subsourian. It can triangulate the exact position of a cloaking effect within 20 kilometers.
Skin/Info/Phoenix=Designed for aerial harassment, phoenixes are known for their unmatched speed and maneuverability. A single strike force can keep an enemy army pinned down even when vastly outnumbered.
Skin/Info/PhoenixGolden=The Shelak tribe has commissioned phoenixes that resemble the escort ships favored by early judicators. Though some see them as controversial symbols, others praise the beautiful craftsmanship.
Skin/Info/PhoenixIhanrii=Though the Ihan-rii phoenix's stone construction doesn't inhibit its maneuverability or top speed, it does make it a more formidable missile when crash-landing.
Skin/Info/PhoenixPurifier=When the Purifiers do not need the phasing technology of the mirages, they will deploy robotic phoenixes to defend their skies.
Skin/Info/PhoenixTaldarim=There is a time for overwhelming force, and a time to be swift and deadly. The Tal'darim recognize the value in the latter, which is why they maintain a fleet of phoenixes stolen from the Templar.
Skin/Info/PhotonCannon=Protoss phase-smiths can outfit their defensive structures with powerful antimatter cannons and advanced detection measures. Experiments integrating photon cannons with warp technology widely ended in failure.
Skin/Info/PhotonCannonForged=Despite their commitment to a rigid warrior code, the Tal'darim have no problem building photon cannons in secret to rain devastation on their enemies' mineral lines.
Skin/Info/PhotonCannonIhanrii=The phase disruptor housing of the Ihan-rii photon cannon features a distinctive wing-shape inspired by a majestic avian creature that once ruled Tyrador IX's skies, at least until it was hunted to extinction by early terran settlers.
Skin/Info/PhotonCannonTaldarim=[ph] PhotonCannonTaldarim info
Skin/Info/PlanetaryFortressCovertOps=The latest planetary fortresses have cannons so powerful that their anchors must be driven three times deeper to prevent them from skidding backward each time they fire.
Skin/Info/Probe=Designed by the Khalai to lay the foundation for protoss settlements, probes are self-sufficient drones that can enable and initiate the warp-in of critical prefabricated structures.
Skin/Info/ProbeBlizzcon17=These probes were salvaged from a destroyed protoss colony by members of a junker gang, who then retrofitted them with terran engines and accessories. If nothing else, their craftsmanship is unique.
Skin/Info/ProbeGolden=A small number of probes have survived since the period following the Aeon of Strife, where even the simplest of protoss robotics had a refined and luxurious appearance.
Skin/Info/ProbeIhanrii=When not in use during long periods of deep-space hibernation, Ihan-rii probes fold into perfect cubes for compact storage.
Skin/Info/ProbePurifier=These probes are models of efficiency and diligence. They operate on enhanced protocols for full integration with the Purifier data web.
Skin/Info/ProbeRemastered=Probes from the Great War era had longer stabilizer fins, but phase-smiths quickly learned that they could become a liability in the midst of a widescale, vicious battle.
Skin/Info/ProbeTaldarim=Probes utilized by the Daelaam are calibrated to gather resources with as little ecological impact as possible. The Tal'darim have no use for such precautions.
Skin/Info/Pylon=Forging a new psionic matrix has been vital to the Daelaam's reconstruction efforts. The khaydarin crystal within each pylon allows the protoss to tap into the matrix's energy.
Skin/Info/PylonForged=Each Tal'darim pylon crackles with enough psionic energy to power sixteen gateways.
Skin/Info/PylonIhanrii=Across areas of Tyrador IX recolonized by the Ihan-rii, proliferating fields of luminescent pylons produce an ethereal glow visible from orbit.
Skin/Info/PylonTaldarim=[ph] PylonTaldarim info
Skin/Info/PylonXPR=Kor-shakal was once the crown jewel of Aiur, a city so resplendent that it defied description. Even structures as simple as its pylons were adorned in shining decorations.
Skin/Info/Queen=To safeguard the future of the Swarm, Kerrigan orchestrated the creation a new breed of queens. Capable of independent thought and analysis, they serve as the hive masters of an ever-evolving Swarm.
Skin/Info/QueenMecha=The magnificent queen was the first completed production model to go missing. Loath to publicly reveal their activities, the Simulant Project managers investigated the matter as quietly as possible.
Skin/Info/QueenPrimal=Primal packs are ruled by strength alone, therefore queens occupy a much different position within them versus more traditional broods, and are rarely present in great numbers.
Skin/Info/QueenRCZ=Queens defend the Cerberus backline with forged titanium blades, jet-powered spine launchers, and matronly instincts even a neurological overhaul couldn't eliminate entirely.
Skin/Info/QueenWebby=Even the queens of the Leviathan Brood are incredibly vicious and hostile. Any creatures foolish enough to approach their clutch with hostile intent find themselves quickly impaled by many spines.
Skin/Info/Ravager=Evolved from roaches after years of genetic modification, ravagers possess the ability to quickly generate massive quantities of corrosive bile and then expel them at their foes.
Skin/Info/RavagerBone=Calcification of zerg carapaces into a hardened shell makes for effective armor. Abathur considers the intimidation factor a welcome bonus.
Skin/Info/RavagerMecha=Simulant ravagers have been fitted with heat-absorbent panels instead of spikes around their plasma fire receptacles to prevent damage to the rest of the model.
Skin/Info/RavagerPrimal=Defiant and bloodthirsty, the primal ravagers will devour their own young if they are not strong enough to fight back. Given this level of aggression, it is uncertain how long their species will thrive.
Skin/Info/RavagerRCZ=The plasma spines on the Cerberus ravager's back superheat the corrosive bile it fires. On Tyrador IX, these ravagers punched massive holes in the terran defense.
Skin/Info/RavagerWebby=Monstrous and towering, the fully evolved ravager is a terrifying sight to behold. The webbed nightmares deployed by the Leviathan Brood are only more so.
Skin/Info/Raven=Invaluable for surveillance and defense, the raven can construct a turret, build a defense drone, or fire missiles at enemy forces. If this wasn't enough, it's also more cost effective than its predecessors.
Skin/Info/RavenCovertOps=The pride of the Dominion Special Forces, this exquisitely designed craft is rumored to be able to detect Kel-Morian miners whispering to each other two kilometers underground.
Skin/Info/RavenJunker=Highly advanced surveillance craft aren't the most popular among mercenaries, but beneath the rust and cracking paint, these ravens are as good as any others in the Dominion.
Skin/Info/RavenSilver=As the Cerberus zerg threatened to overwhelm Tyrador IX's defenders, a high-altitude raven detected a fleet of strange stone ships in the planet's gravity well.
Skin/Info/RavenUmojan=The height of sophistication, these ravens are equipped with a little-understood artificial intelligence system that exceeds anything that Dominion engineers would ever approve.
Skin/Info/Reactor=While researching protoss containment fields, terran scientists made a breakthrough that allowed commanders to double their production capacity.
Skin/Info/ReactorCovertOps=Cutting-edge reactors now rival the energy output of thor engines, with only marginally reduced reliability.
Skin/Info/ReactorSilver=Presidential suites in Tyrador IX's five-star resorts each come with their own military-grade reactor, in recognition of the complex recreational electronics and cybernetics the wealthiest guests tend to bring along.
Skin/Info/Reaper=Recruits who prove resistant to resocialization are trained as Reapers. Hyper-aggressive and prone to taking risks, these shock troopers seldom survive a full tour of duty.
Skin/Info/ReaperCovertOps=In the wake of recent reforms, reapers are no longer forced to use dangerous stimulants to increase their performance. The recruiting process now favors candidates who are naturally unpredictable.
Skin/Info/ReaperJunker=There's never a shortage of reapers among Mira's Marauders. They tend to outdo themselves scrapping together their distinctive armor—particularly the mohawks.
Skin/Info/ReaperSilver=On Tyrador IX, an invasion force of Cerberus zerg was spotted by a reaper taking the long way home to avoid a dust storm near New Canaan.
Skin/Info/ReaperUmojan=Over the course of many years, the Umojan Protectorate was able to psychologically profile enough suitable candidates to create their own Reaper Corps with surprisingly good results.
Skin/Info/Refinery=The refinery is designed to extract raw vespene gas and package it into a handy cylinder, which is easily transportable by space construction vehicles.
Skin/Info/RefineryCovertOps=The special forces refinery harvests vespene just as fast as the regulation model, but produces 75% less noise.
Skin/Info/RefinerySilver=Despite diligent maintenance, Tyrador IX's refineries have reported lower-than-average vespene yields since the Cerberus attack, as if the underground reservoirs they tap have been diverted.
Skin/Info/Roach=Roaches were hand-selected by the Queen of Blades for assimilation into the Swarm. Their impressive tissue regeneration and acidic venom make them resilient as well as deadly.
Skin/Info/RoachDeluxe=Under Zagara's orders, Abathur has continued to manipulate the zerg genome in search of perfection. The roach's innate regenerative abilities make it the ideal candidate for such a pursuit.
Skin/Info/RoachMecha=These machines have been outfitted with a sophisticated self-repair system to replicate the roach's incredible healing ability, while also combatting structural damage from its acid reserves.
Skin/Info/RoachPrimal=Roaches were among the first to be absorbed into primal packs on Zerus, where they developed the capability to mutate into primal igniters and primal guardians.
Skin/Info/RoachRCZ=Cerberus scientists bulwarked the roach's already-impressive armor with a carbon fiber nanoweave. Forged titanium blades were added to aid its offensive capabilities as well.
Skin/Info/RoachWarren=Generating roaches and ravagers requires humid, dark conditions. The roach warren is a perfectly constructed biological organ that replicates this environment precisely.
Skin/Info/RoachWarrenMecha=Significant polymer-alloy innovations were necessary to develop a housing for the Simulant roach warren that would withstand the turmoil of its internal acid generation.
Skin/Info/RoachWarrenRCZ=Cerberus adaptations of zerg structures like the roach warren produce self-replicating blueprints for remote control equipment to be installed synchronous with larval development.
Skin/Info/RoachWebby=Much like the zantar slugs they are derived from, roaches display an incredible potential for adaptation. Vespene exposure has been known to cause those of Leviathan Brood to grow incredibly aggressive.
Skin/Info/RoboticsBay=The robotics bay serves as the primary research and development facility of the khalai's foremost phase-smiths.
Skin/Info/RoboticsBayForged=Terrazine fumes leak from the dark, ominous claw that is the Tal'darim robotics bay.
Skin/Info/RoboticsBayIhanrii=The segmented assembly arms of the Ihan-rii robotics bay move with flexibility and speed that belie their stone composition.
Skin/Info/RoboticsFacility=Phase-smiths require expansive facilities to warp in enormous war automatons, such as the colossus.
Skin/Info/RoboticsFacilityForged=An armored housing and heavy-duty, reinforced anchors give the Tal'darim robotics facility an intimidating profile.
Skin/Info/RoboticsFacilityIhanrii=The Ihan-rii have been evasive when questioned about the frenzied activity of their newly constructed robotics facilities, which churn out heavily armed units at all hours of the day and night.
Skin/Info/RoboticsFacilityTaldarim=[ph] RoboticsFacilityTaldarim info
Skin/Info/RoboticsSupportBayTaldarim=[ph] RoboticsSupportBayTaldarim info
Skin/Info/SCV=The T-280 SCV is a staple of construction and repair across all terran worlds. A versatile and reliable workhorse, the Space Construction Vehicle is an invaluable industrial tool.
Skin/Info/SCVBlizzcon17=Even junker gangs have to collect minerals and vespene gas, though they try to do so in an intimidating style.
Skin/Info/SCVCovertOps=Due to the unique demands of covert missions, even the SCVs must be outfitted with all of the latest upgrades, including a stronger utility clamp and new laser extraction claw.
Skin/Info/SCVJunker=Tired of low pay and long hours in the Dominion, some SCV pilots choose to go the mercenary route. It's safe to say that most of them never look back.
Skin/Info/SCVRemastered=T-280 SCVs dating back before the Brood War featured a different, less bulky appearance with smaller utility clamps and, purportedly, secret cup holders.
Skin/Info/SCVSilver=When selecting armor for their planetary defense force, the Knights of Tyrador chose a platinum-iridium alloy to maximize gleam and scratchproofing.
Skin/Info/SCVUmojan=Simple, sturdy, and reliable, these SCVs feature laser drills that make perfectly clean cuts on even the densest minerals.
Skin/Info/SensorTower=Using a combination of electromagnetic and thermal technology alongside Doppler analysis and seismic sensors, the multispectrum output of these towers causes them to be easily detectable by enemies.
Skin/Info/SensorTowerCovertOps=After a false alarm triggered by an overlarge moth led to the vaporization of a Mar Sara trading post, the new line of sensor towers had its perceptive power dialed back slightly.
Skin/Info/SensorTowerSilver=Soon after the Cerberus zerg attacked, Tyrador sensor towers began detecting strange seismic patterns, but these were attributed to widespread Ihan-rii construction efforts.
Skin/Info/Sentry=Robotic combat drones outfitted with force field generators and holo-projectors, sentries were developed in order to support and protect the dwindling numbers of protoss warriors.
Skin/Info/SentryGolden=Sentries themselves have no clear predecessors within protoss robotics, but imaginative phase-smiths have redesigned them to complement other vessels with longer histories.
Skin/Info/SentryIhanrii=Long ago, the Ihan-rii protoss harnessed volatile xel'naga artifacts known as "nebula wells" to power their sentries. Few of these artifacts remain.
Skin/Info/SentryPurifier=Though Purifier armies often prefer energizers, some sentries are present within their ranks. These drones have been integrated into the Purifier data web rather than relying on psionic energy.
Skin/Info/SentryTaldarim=While most sentries seized by the Tal'darim are refitted into havocs, some are left mostly unchanged. This results in a varied array of robotic support and a certain degree of misdirection.
Skin/Info/ShieldBattery=Shield batteries were largely abandoned in the wake of the Brood War due to advancements in shield regeneration. After improvements were made to its throughput and capacity, some factions reintegrated the technology.
Skin/Info/ShieldBatteryForged=Though the Tal'darim have access to shield batteries, they typically prefer to invest their resources in more aggressive pursuits.
Skin/Info/ShieldBatteryIhanrii=To justify their construction of a vast shield battery defense network and a powerful standing army, the Ihan-rii cite "defense against unruly wildlife."
Skin/Info/SiegeTank=A modern replacement for the aging Arclite model, Crucio siege tanks are both versatile and heavy hitting. Battlefield commanders swear by them for both offense and defense.
Skin/Info/SiegeTankCovertOps=Though the Crucio has long been popular among the Dominion commanders, it was not without room for improvement. Reinforced plating and heftier cannons make this version even more formidable.
Skin/Info/SiegeTankJunker=These beastly tanks are so heavily modified that they hardly resemble their original Crucio models. They fare much better than their predecessors when it comes to impromptu demolition matches.
Skin/Info/SiegeTankMerc=Terran mercenaries can always find ways to customize their vehicles, whether it's adding speed through engine optimization, versatility in control configurations, or cosmetic changes to intimidate enemies.
Skin/Info/SiegeTankSilver=Dignitaries above a certain rank are greeted upon their arrival in Tyrador with a ten-round salute from a company of spotless platinum-alloy siege tanks.
Skin/Info/SiegeTankUmojan=Umojan Imperio tanks are a recent invention that has already rivaled their Dominion counterparts in early combat tests—which was precisely their goal.
Skin/Info/SpawningPool=The spawning pool's large chambers have grown to house the genetic mutations for organisms other than the zergling, including a flightless variant of the queen.
Skin/Info/SpawningPoolMecha=Polymer-titanium composites allow the Simulant spawning pool to flex and conform to the volatile ooze it contains.
Skin/Info/SpawningPoolRCZ=Cybernetic enhancements keep Cerberus spawning pools in temperature and pH ranges considerably more precise than their pure-biological antecedents.
Skin/Info/SpineCrawler=Following the Brood War, the swarm generated spine crawlers to better protect itself from ground threats. They are capable of repositioning around the battlefield to gain area control.
Skin/Info/SpineCrawlerMecha=A spearpoint terminating in a monomolecular tip allows the Simulant spine crawler to penetrate even the thickest terran armor.
Skin/Info/SpineCrawlerRCZ=Cerberus has tasked thousands of remote-control spine crawlers with expanding the lava tube networks that criss-cross Tyrador IX's crust.
Skin/Info/Spire=The towering nests of the mantis screamers formed the basis for the zerg spire. The stalks that form their foundation are made of flexible muscle.
Skin/Info/SpireMecha=A reservoir of propellant gases for Simulant mutalisks and corruptors keeps the spire bobbing against its restraint cables.
Skin/Info/SpireRCZ=Mutalisks from subterranean Cerberus spires exhibit echolocative hunting behavior absorbed from Tyrador gigabats, previously the planet's scariest cave-dwelling creature.
Skin/Info/SporeCrawler=Spore colonies were not enough to prevent the Overmind's elimination. In order to protect their species, zerg evolved their air defense, creating the more flexible spore crawler.
Skin/Info/SporeCrawlerMecha=The first terran pilot to discover that the Simulant spore crawler's fake ammunition had been replaced by a nano-facsimile of the real thing was awarded a generous pension and gold-plated replacement legs.
Skin/Info/SporeCrawlerRCZ=Cerberus spore crawlers amass in caverns near Tyrador IX's surface like great fields of pulsing, spiny stalagmites.
Skin/Info/Stalker=Created by the Nerazim, stalkers are machines that are infused with the shadow essences of their warriors. The ability to teleport makes them both swift and unpredictable.
Skin/Info/StalkerDeluxe=The Nerazim's stalker technology has benefited from Khalai engineering. The protoss are now experimenting with integrating dragoon chassis reinforcements into the battle strider frame.
Skin/Info/StalkerGolden=Khalai phase-smiths have attempted to recreate Nerazim's stalkers in the elegant style of the ancient Templar. Unfortunately, their results elicited more offense than admiration.
Skin/Info/StalkerIhanrii=These stalkers are inscribed with sacred runes meant to safeguard their animated stone armor against the heretic enemies of the Ihan-rii.
Skin/Info/StalkerPurifier=The Purifiers have further refined stalker programming to draw from a complex log of battle interactions, allowing them to perform well even though they are fully automated.
Skin/Info/StalkerTaldarim=Not all Tal'darim seek ascension. Those who wish only to sharpen their combat skills and serve their Highlord often choose to become stalkers, in order to better hunt and kill their foes.
Skin/Info/Stargate=The process of warping in capital ships requires such a vast amount of energy that the excess light emission can be witnessed from vast distances.
Skin/Info/StargateForged=The elongated structure of the Tal'darim stargate helps newly summoned ships accelerate out of the bay and directly into battle.
Skin/Info/StargateIhanrii=Though the Ihan-rii claim to be satisfied with partial inhabitation of their ancestral homeworld, their stargates have begun to produce interstellar capital ships, which would suggest somewhat more imperial motives.
Skin/Info/StargateTaldarim=[ph] StargateTaldarim info
Skin/Info/Starport=The Dominion Marine Corps combat handbook makes very clear that air superiority is vital to terran dominance in the Koprulu sector and beyond. 
Skin/Info/StarportCovertOps=After each mission is complete, the special forces starport carries its crew and cargo into orbit, where it functions as a fully operational space station.
Skin/Info/StarportSilver=Proliferating extraplanetary threats have led the Knights of Tyrador to accelerate their starport production schedules, but the Ihan-rii seem to be amassing air units just as quickly.
Skin/Info/SupplyDepot=Every CO worth their salt knows the importance of a supply line. Without a depot fully stocked with food and ammo, warfare is simply impossible.
Skin/Info/SupplyDepotCovertOps=On hotter planets, this supply depot's supercharged ventilation system makes it a popular spot for off-duty marines to crack open a few cold ones.
Skin/Info/SupplyDepotSilver=The unicorn sigil atop each Knights of Tyrador supply depot is hand-polished twice daily, usually by the freshest and lowest-ranking recruits.
Skin/Info/SupplyDepotXPR=After the tragic loss of its heir apparent, Angel Shipping is back in business. The company's shipments are guaranteed to arrive on the frontline ahead of schedule and under budget.
Skin/Info/SwarmHost=The Swarm excels at proliferation, especially the hideous Swarm Host. By rapidly birthing multitudes of locusts, a single Swarm Host can overwhelm an enemy army.
Skin/Info/SwarmHostMecha=Engineers began to fall ill while working on the swarm host mechanics. However, the safety systems did not report a problem, and production continued undisturbed—fatalities aside.
Skin/Info/SwarmHostPrimal=These creatures have developed as an offshoot of the primal hosts, who were the progenitors of all swarm hosts. Now, through a surprising twist of fate, the strains have merged once more.
Skin/Info/SwarmHostRCZ=The Cerberus swarm host contains an internal microfactory that equips each locust with remote-control headgear.
Skin/Info/SwarmHostWebby=The swarm hosts of the Leviathan Brood are uniquely specialized for amphibious assault and bear many genetic advantages that allow them to move quickly through the oceans and assail their prey.
Skin/Info/TechLab=Once combat buildings are established, small tech labs are built alongside them to undertake research and development work. Some of this work can be dangerous, but it is seen essential to the war effort.
Skin/Info/TechLabCovertOps=The special forces tech lab uses nanotechnology pilfered from the Dominion's protoss allies to maximize energy efficiency and research speed.
Skin/Info/TechLabSilver=Knights of Tyrador tech labs feature state-of-the-art climate control systems to maintain peak efficiency through the planet's intense shifts in temperature.
Skin/Info/Tempest=Tempests are a recent addition to the Golden Armada, and have earned their place as one of the fleet’s most powerful warships. Their volatile disintegration weaponry is a force to be reckoned with.
Skin/Info/TempestGolden=After some experimentation, phase-smiths created customized tempests with high-sheen ornamental plating that could withstand the destructive energies of the vessel's kinetic matrix.
Skin/Info/TempestIhanrii=The dampening effect of the Ihan-rii tempest's stone surface enhances its ability to focus the incredible power output of its kinetic matrix.
Skin/Info/TempestPurifier=This remotely piloted vessel is one of the signature achievements of the Purifier program, and its Cybros manufactured plating is among the most distinctive of its kind.
Skin/Info/TempestTaldarim=Occasionally, the Daelaam impress the Tal'darim. The creation of the tempest was one such moment. Upon first seeing them in combat, the Highlord vowed to seize them for the death fleet.
Skin/Info/TemplarArchive=The high templar hone their psionic abilities at the templar archives by accessing and studying the memories and experiences of their predecessors.
Skin/Info/TemplarArchiveForged=In between battles, Tal'darim warriors ranked highly on the Chain of Ascension can visit the templar archives to relive their most heroic feats.
Skin/Info/TemplarArchiveIhanrii=Ihan-rii templar archives contain the civilization's most closely guarded secrets, including religious texts and instructions for the gruesome semi-organic generation of animated stone.
Skin/Info/Thor=The ultimate expression of terran military might, the Thor is outfitted with enough artillery to take down an army of enemy combatants on its own.
Skin/Info/ThorCE=Improving on the Thor has become an informal competition amongst Dominion engineers. Top brass is content with allowing this trend to continue, as long as it results in more powerful siege walkers.
Skin/Info/ThorCovertOps=A signature achievement in recent weapons engineering, the Dominion Special Forces thor boasts innumerable upgrades and the latest in neosteel plating advancements.
Skin/Info/ThorJunker=Mira's crew has long desired a Thor of their own, but construction challenges routinely set them back. Any day now, they could find a way to assemble one that is fully functional...
Skin/Info/ThorSilver=Tyrador thors are treated with a plutonium coating that deflects projectiles below a certain energy threshold. They also look great in parades.
Skin/Info/ThorUmojan=After years of fervent exploration, the Umojan Protectorate has finally come up with its answer to the Dominion's Thor, and its impressiveness is only matched by the number of Umojan symbols it sports.
Skin/Info/TwilightCouncil=The twilight council serves as a meeting place for representatives of the Daelaam to discuss the betterment of all protoss.
Skin/Info/TwilightCouncilForged=Another stolen Khalai structure, the Tal'darim twilight council's architecture is more intimidating and somber, though the upgrades it bestows are identical.
Skin/Info/TwilightCouncilIhanrii=Ihan-rii council elders have found the return to their homeworld, Arakyr, both familiar and unsettling. Much has changed in their long absence, including a decline in air quality and the extinction of several beloved species, both attributable to terran development.
Skin/Info/Ultralisk=Ultralisks are legendary for their size and strength. Their armored carapaces are nearly impenetrable, and their gargantuan pincers can both crush and eviscerate their enemies with ease.
Skin/Info/UltraliskCE=Ultralisks are powerful and destructive enough as they are. When infused with the essence of Zerus's primal zerg, however, they become truly unstoppable killing machines.
Skin/Info/UltraliskCavern=This cavern is filled with dangerous biological deposits infused with high radiation. The chemical reactions created within are used to build the genetic code required for the ultralisk.
Skin/Info/UltraliskCavernMecha=The Simulant Project ultralisk cavern houses its radioactive innards within a converted battlecruiser engine heatshield.
Skin/Info/UltraliskCavernRCZ=This ultralisk cavern churns out three sets of gleaming forged-titanium blades every hour, an intimidating purpose only slightly undermined by the fact that--as a Cerberus vice president once wryly observed--the lights above its mouth look like goofy little eyes.
Skin/Info/UltraliskMecha=Early in the project, it was agreed that the team would never construct a replica of the ultralisk. When chaos later overtook the lab, it became clear that the agreement had been broken...
Skin/Info/UltraliskPrimal=Primal ultralisks exhibit a high level of variety in their appearance, with some closely resembling the Swarm ultralisks, and others adapting different features better suited to life on Zerus.
Skin/Info/UltraliskRCZ=Cerberus sales teams always make sure to show prospective clients the remote-control ultralisk. Their heat-treated titanium blade implants are a beautiful sight to behold.
Skin/Info/UltraliskRemastered=Early ultralisks were slimmer and more agile than their modern-day counterparts, with swaths of durable muscle and sinew instead of bulky armor.
Skin/Info/UltraliskWebby=Few other living creatures can match the sheer might of the ultralisks. Those birthed by the Leviathan Brood are terrifying visages of spines and blades--monsters worthy of legend.
Skin/Info/Viking=Developed to bolster the Terran Dominion's anti-air forces, the Viking is a modern classic thanks to its two versatile combat modes.
Skin/Info/VikingCovertOps=Dominion researchers have added a new set of twin engines to complement the existing design of the viking, while increasing its firepower in both modes.
Skin/Info/VikingJunker=Mira's mechanics have given their Vikings a number of special additions, including massive twin engines that produce an impressively intimidating roar when fully revved.
Skin/Info/VikingMecha=Under Emperor Valerian's orders, Castillo Industries has developed a breakthrough in Viking technology. Their prototype features a sleeker and more efficient construction.
Skin/Info/VikingSilver=At night, the stunning blue thrusters on this viking can be spotted from miles away, reassuring tourists that the Knights of Tyrador are watching over them.
Skin/Info/VikingUmojan=After a protracted negotiation, Castillo Industries has agreed to manufacture a new, heavily plated Viking model exclusively for the Umojan Protectorate.
Skin/Info/Viper=Originally a part of the primal zerg, the vipers' sequences were incorporated into the Swarm by Abathur himself. Now, they serve as a tool to manipulate the battlefield to their master's liking.
Skin/Info/ViperMecha=As the Simulant Project neared its completion, the directors became increasingly concerned about what they had created—and at what cost. The project owners stopped answering questions around this point.
Skin/Info/ViperPrimal=The original viper specimens possess a number of uniquely vicious defenses, making it no surprise that they came to Abathur's attention as prime candidates for further evolution.
Skin/Info/ViperRCZ=Vipers with hammerhead cranial implants demonstrate dramatic increases in prehensile proboscis precision.
Skin/Info/ViperWebby=As one of the original zerg broods, Leviathan vipers exhibit more defiler tendencies than the rest of the Swarm. While this has caused many abnormalities to surface, its potent toxins appear to be worth it.
Skin/Info/VoidRay=The result of combining Templar and Nerazim technology, void rays are devastating assault ships that demonstrate what is possible when the two factions unite for a common cause.
Skin/Info/VoidRayGolden=The latest void rays have combined the classical refinement of ancient Templar construction with the shadowy coloration favored by the Nerazim.
Skin/Info/VoidRayIhanrii=On Tyrador IX, a fleet of stone ships with shrieking void-energy beams appeared and blindsided the Cerberus zerg just as they overran New Canaan's defenses.
Skin/Info/VoidRayPurifier=The Purifier void ray is a true feat in engineering, combining the research of three different protoss factions in a single elegant vessel.
Skin/Info/VoidRayTaldarim=Bloodshard crystals are not easily collected. When the Tal'darim do not have enough of them to convert a void ray into a destroyer, they make use of the ship's existing armaments without hesitation.
Skin/Info/WarpPrism=By acting as a conduit into the psionic matrix, warp prisms function as both mobile troop transport and emergency power source. Though they are fragile, no protoss fleet is complete without them.
Skin/Info/WarpPrismGolden=Ancient Templar warp prisms featured a distinctive crystal lattice that would sometimes reflect the neural patterns of the warriors they transport.
Skin/Info/WarpPrismIhanrii=Unfurled, the Ihan-rii warp prism evokes a flower that once covered the hillsides of their homeworld, referred to by its current residents as "Tyrador IX."
Skin/Info/WarpPrismNerazim=Daelaam phase-smiths have broken new ground by adapting warp prisms to use Void energy. These variants, known as phase prisms, have already earned great popularity with Nerazim commanders.
Skin/Info/WarpPrismPurifier=Purifier warp prisms can automatically transfer an AI personality between different shells if needed, and warp prisms enable this to happen anywhere on the battlefield.
Skin/Info/WarpPrismTaldarim=Arming warp prisms with advanced weaponry is a point of contention among the fleet lords. Some prefer to use them to simply deploy their own warriors onto the battlefield.
Skin/Info/WidowMine=Initially developed by Victor Kachinsky, the widow mine has been refined into a surprisingly lethal device that can fire defensive missiles against unsuspecting enemies.
Skin/Info/WidowMineCovertOps=Perplexed by occasional misfires in the past, technicians have added more protective plating to the widow mines to better contain accidents and protect against unintended injuries.
Skin/Info/WidowMineJunker=After several rounds of heavily destructive experimentation, Mira's mercs redesigned their widow mines to accommodate additional weaponry and explosives.
Skin/Info/WidowMineSilver=Despite gory accidents that make the news from time to time, sleek and shiny widow mines remain a common pet in the upper-class households of Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/WidowMineUmojan=Always fond of robotics, the Umojan engineers held an exclusive competition to craft the perfect widow mine and were thrilled to discover that the winner was still a student finishing her degree.
Skin/Info/Zealot=Peerless warriors on the battlefield, zealots undergo decades of intense training in order to perfect their combat skills. Their signature psi-blades are formed with their own psionic energy.
Skin/Info/ZealotGolden=Many zealots were quick to follow the high templar in celebrating the protoss' golden age, along with its artistic and cultural achievements. However, the movement has received no official recognition thus far.
Skin/Info/ZealotIhanrii=Zealots of the Ihan-rii protoss believe the xel'naga will return one day to bless valiant warriors with eternal godhood.
Skin/Info/ZealotPurifier=Though they do not possess unique personalities, the sentinels are programmed to be noble warriors equal to their zealot brethren.
Skin/Info/ZealotRemastered=To demonstrate their fearlessness, many zealots went without head armor during the Great War. This practice has since been discontinued.
Skin/Info/ZealotTaldarim=The lowest ranking links in the Chain of Ascension are also the ones most eager to prove themselves. A zealot of the Tal'darim is a dangerous foe to face.
Skin/Info/ZealotXPR=Though the Conclave no longer exists, the praetors who served as its military leaders are still loyal to the Daelaam. For as long as the protoss live, they will continue to fight with valor.
Skin/Info/Zergling=Savage and feral, zerglings are most dangerous when attacking in large groups that are controlled by a larger and more advanced strain of zerg.
Skin/Info/ZerglingMecha=Though they look and act just like zerglings, the simulants are purely mechanical reproductions that run wholly on electrical power sources, rather than absorbing the DNA of their enemies.
Skin/Info/ZerglingPrimal=Some of the smaller primal zerglings have been known to resemble their counterparts in the Swarm, even to the point where they possess similar attack capabilities.
Skin/Info/ZerglingRCZ=Zergling nervous systems are so hyperactive that Cerberus engineers had to affix two antennas to control their movement properly.
Skin/Info/ZerglingWebby=The reduction of the zergling genome has had unpredictable results. The growths present on Leviathan zerglings are not intentionally evolved, but a byproduct of their extremely simplified DNA.
Skin/Info/ZerglingXPR=Few zerg have a shorter life expectancy than the zergling. Any mutation that appears to increase that life expectancy is considered worthy of observation and analysis.
