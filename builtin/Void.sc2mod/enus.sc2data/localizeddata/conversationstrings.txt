Conversation/InfantryJumper/Line00029=Alright, Space mining 101. They call this badboy an ARC gun. You point it an asteroid, squeeze the trigger, and BLAM, nothing but meteors.
Conversation/InfantryJumper/Line00030=I figure if  it can crack open an asteroid, it can damn sure crack open a zerg.
Conversation/InfantryJumper/Line00032=Hey! Don't push me around like I'm one of your military men. I'm a miner, not a major.
