Button/Tooltip/ApolloCloakOnNova3=Switches into close combat mode, where this unit gains a 3 range anti-ground line attack that deals increased damage against light units.<n/><n/>The old warbot models were made considering limitations of their time, including a much worse fuel. Nowadays two of the three main fuel tanks are not needed, because modern combustibles are a lot more effective.

Button/Tooltip/ApolloCloakOnNova332=Switches into emergency rrepair mode, where this unit becomes immobile, gains 15 health regeneration and will take 65% less damage.<n/><n/>The warbot's idle mode has a rather interesting unintended feature. It folds itself into a more structurally stable and durable form. A lot of parts that previously were exposed to incoming attacks also become hidden by other mechanical limbs, theoretically allowing for repair welder arms to deploy and repair damaged plating while it is safe from harm. Some funds will be needed for researching these emergency repairs.

The steel used for Atlas Guards isn't extremely protective to keep it light and quick to regrow in seconds, but the survival rate of the marines using it has increased by 95%.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232222=Atlas Guards gain the ability to heal health and gain slightly increased attack and movement speeds for 10 seconds. Is auto-cast automatically.<n/><n/>While originally stimpacks were used to increase combat potential of marines, the right chemical formula can make it alot stronger as a tool to heal wounds. The newest systems allow to infalte and heavily harden the flesh around the area, where the stimpack was injected, partially covering up the holes in the combat armor aswell.

Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322223=Blockade Runners will automatically bombard nearby ground enemies every second, firing 12 missiles that deal 4 damage in an area.<n/><n/>While most of the weapons on Blockade Runners are replaced by thrusters that help manuver in warp space, it is possible to replace the blocked Yamato cannon chamber with a set of plasma torpedo launchers. They are devastating against anything on a large surface, but studies have shown that this missile model misses 99.875% of air units, even in clustered fleets.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222232=After Warp Shift ends, Blockade Runners will do everything 150% faster and take 75% less damage. The bonus decays over 5 seconds.<n/><n/>Through extreme ingenuity to stride through warp space like mysterious Xel'naga vessels were seen doing. A warp dynamic hull was designed specifically to replicate certain elements of those ancient structures, which somehow manages to keep the ship inbetween both spaces and slowly transfer it from one to another.  Of course, all smugglers who invented it were executed a while ago and noone to this day understands how their designs work.

It's even enough to basically triple their firepower.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222242=Leonidas Companies gain 75% movement speed and 150% attack speed when they haven't taken damage in 10 seconds.<n/><n/>Through some adjustments, it becomes possible to redirect Leonidas Company shielding power to weapons and movement servos.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222243=Units healed by Saint Troopers cannot take fatal damage.<n/><n/>Saint Troopers have designed a peculiar design to create a force field around the people in their care. Device can only support most vital organs.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232222432=Saint Troopers will no longer cost vespene gas and need 1 less supplies.<n/><n/>Typically miracle-level medicine is expensive. Saint Troopers have always taken pride in finding the best deals for medicine, but there's always more cheapskating to do. A lot of military medicine can be found on medics around terran systems ravaged by the zerg. Typically fringe worlds are pretty safe to scavange in after 4 years and many mercenaries set up camps there, as government soldiers and pirate stations are way more dangerous.

Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222244=Penetration Divisions will launch up to 8 missiles at enemies around their targets, when they start their volley.<n/><n/>Penetration Divisions can add additional missile launchers that will fire a single rocket at the start of each one of their volleys.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232222442=Penetration Division missiles will deal double damage to main target and usual damage to enemies in small range around it.<n/><n/>Lars Corp. Type-IV Rapid Bolt missiles have been designed to penetrate their targets, then perform 2 quick detonations so that one opens large holes and the other launches shrapnel at nearby targets through the wounds in main opponent.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322224422=Sky Watchers will fire at up to 2 enemies while in Sky Watch instead of 1.<n/><n/>Sky Watchers already use 2 launchers, however, they are fired one after another due to lack of crew and safety on easily malfunctioning launching devices. If both devices are connected to one another and slightly improved, a 50% larger active gunner count can manage both launchers at once.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222244222=Every time Sky Watchers attack in Sky Watch, they will do everything 33% faster for 5 seconds. Stacks up to 3 times.<n/><n/>Sky Watchers are kept mostly without temperature control outside of their bridge and cargo storage, as their operations occur during absolute zero temperatures for motnhs and it isn't possible to keep power for warmth during that time on such a crowded vessel. This leaves certain servos in missile launchers a lot less efficient then they could be. However, by making certain metals in them a lot more temperature absorbing, the ship can warm it's own servos up every time it fires one of the sky watch missiles
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322224423=Ravager Paratroopers will launch 2 types of bombs at ground enemies rather than using their usual attacks.<n/>They will throw bombs at structures, which deal 45 damage each every 3 seconds.<n/>They will toss explosives at units, which deal 15(20 bonus to light) damage to the main target and knock back enemies in a small radius every 3 seconds.<n/><n/>Throughout their 32 years in the business, Ravager Gang have designed a plethora of different explosives. By paying extra price we can request special armaments for most special occasions. Each Paratrooper will arm themselves with P-225 Triple-Detonation Drill Bombs and Type-VVII Personal Seismic Charges.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222244232=Ravager Gang Dropships and Ravager Paratroopers will release a wave of corrosive neurotoxin on death, causing enemies in a large area to loose all sight and 3 ranged weapon range for 15 seconds. Deals 60 damage over that time.<n/><n/>The fuel used for Ravager Gang jetpacks and dropship engines is already extremely hazardous. By mixing it with additional chemicals whenever the paratrooper or pilot dies, remaining substance will be turned into an extremely deadly toxin that will corrode weapons, sight sensors, armor, eyes or flesh.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232222443=Mainland Hunters gain 50% attack speed bonus and 1 armor for every 0.5 seconds when they are moving. Stacks up to 5 times and lasts 6 seconds.<n/><n/>Mainland Hunters arm their Hellions with twin wind turbines which slightly recharge their batteries, which helps a lot in outrunning the police and military of an entire planet. As they don't need to drive as much in certain other situations, it's possible to redirect spare energy to their weapons and shielding.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322224432=Mainland Hunters gain ability to fire a missile at a unit, dealing 25(175 bonus to shields) damage to main target and 15(85 bonus to shields) area damage. Contains multiple charges.<n/><n/>Mainland Hunters sometimes get a military-grade AI to aim precise EMP missiles to get more evasive targets. There has been a spike in popularity of extremely powerful personal shielding devices among high class people who have a chance of being assassinated.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223=Mutineers gain a shield, which grants 40% incoming damage reduction and 1 weapon range, but slow down the Mutineer by 50%. Trench Shield is not active while on Move command.<n/><n/>This cancelled infantry shield design can be received from an old Dominion weapons lab for the right price. It is extremely heavy and durable. Soldiers can  support bipods of their weapons on them to aim better as well. However the hand exo-skeleton of marine armor can barely hold it, making the shield slow it's user when not holstered.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322232=Mutineer weapons will fire an additonal 5(10 vs Biological) damage attack at enemies, if they are 3 or less range away from them.<n/><n/>This ATVX-developed weapon modification improves C-15 Gauss Rifles. It allows for a second magazine to be inserted into the gun and fire twice as many rounds. Most bullets are too big to fit into the secondary magazine, but old short-ranged incendiary rounds should still function properly.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222322=Allows Mutineers to gain the ability to gain 35% attack speed and 2 weapon range, but loose 6 armor for 10 seconds for the cost of 15 health.<n/><n/>For a long time people doubted that this chemical made by Central Medical Institute could turn people into sharpshooters by injecting adrenaline and influencing muscle memory. When CMI were on the edge of bankruptcy the price of the chemical recipe fell drastically and became available to most paramilitary forces.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223222=Units attacked by Mosstroopers will take 50% more damage for 2 seconds.<n/><n/>Blue Intel have developed technology that can "destabilize" matter of a soldier or a vehicle, making their material more vulnerable to incoming attacks. This displacement cannot be physically kept for more than a few seconds, but it can still be taken advantage of.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322232222=Mosstroopers will gain 10% increased attack speed every attack for 10 seconds. Stacks up to 6 times.<n/><n/>This modification designed by LarsCorp overclocks firing mechanisms to a near-critical level. It significantly boosts the grenade output, but can only be safely activated if weapons were fired recently.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222322222=Mosstroopers will gain 2 armor and move 10% slower every time they take damage. Stacks up to 5 times and each stack lasts 4 seconds.<n/><n/>This advanced armor layering developed by Wolfe Industries has been designed to adapt to incoming attacks and slowly harden on impacts. It will make Mosstroopers extremely resistant in large and long fights.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223223=Medical Officers will heal twice as much for the same energy cost.<n/><n/>CMI secretly developed this concoction for extra profits from large military groups, even if it was against their principles. Statistically, it is twice as effective as usual medical officer surgical chemicals and does not cost more to create. Any side effects or risks of using the secret formula were not disclosed.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322232232=Instead of dying, Medical Officers will use 35 energy and heal half of their health.<n/><n/>This system was initially developed by addicts, then used by human traffickers to subdue their targets. It scans the user and injects drugs all across their body if they were suffering from withdrawal. With a bit of tinkering, medical officers can receive a similar system that injects their medical supplies when the officers are near death.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222322322=Units healed by Medical Officers will deal 1 additional damage for 10 seconds. Stacks up to 8 times, each stack is applied for every second the Medical Officer is healing a target.<n/><n/>Steroids were initially added to surgical beams by medics themselves, because they often experienced forces just giving up the fight while being healed. After some research, this was proven to be an effective way of keeping troops aggressive and relentless in their attacks.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223224=Mongrels will gain a shield equal to 50% of the damage they deal. Can gather up to 200 shields and the shield is automatically degenerates at a rate of 3 shields/sec.<n/><n/>This advanced Blue Intel shield projector gathers electricity through open wires, typically on the edges of blades or mechanical claws. It can also use biological material as fuel, but it's not as effective.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322232242=Mongrels will deal 7 additional damage per each point of armor their main target has.<n/><n/>These claws are superheated before attacking and can pierce through almost anything. The thicker the armor is, the more damage it causes when punctured, colliding with itself and stabbing softer layers of it's user.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222322422=Mongrel attacks will also stun mechanical units for 1 second in an area around them.<n/><n/>By simply upsizing the power core of Mongrels, it becomes possible to not only disable exterior shields, but also interior electronics with their EMWs. A custom weapon designed from Deadman's Port can design this improvement for a fee.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322233=Raiders gain a powerful anti-structure attack.<n/><n/>After the weakening of zerg swarm and increase in terran conflicts, demand for destroying structures rather than stealing or scrapping them has fallen in favour of reduced prices for harassment fighters. This caused the price of LarsCorp's premium D-10 charges to also become more reasonable.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222332=Raiders gain 1 movement speed and will take 35% less damage while on Move command.<n/><n/>These old jet pack add-ons were deemed too dangerous, even if theoretically they could make their user a lot more evasive. A few pirates from Deadman's Port have utilized them for years nonetheless and perfected their design. They even started selling the safe turbopacks to the biggest bidders.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223322=Raiders gain sight over cliffs and will see 5 range farther.<n/><n/>Fighters with jetpacks have always complained about not being able to see exactly where they were ordered to jump to until it was too late. While most commanders dismissed their complaints, not everyone needed single-use siege tank finders. Old ComSat tech can be purchased from remote colonies that still use them to increase awareness of raiders.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223323=Tykes gain 75 health and will take 60% less splash and ability damage.<n/><n/>Wolfe Industries have developed heavy infantry suit frames made out of newly discovered vanadium. They make units generally more resistance to all sorts of damage, but blasts and psionic attacks are particularly ineffective against them.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322233232=Tykes gain an anti-air missile attack that deals increased damage to armored targets.<n/><n/>The B0L1 model of the colonial defense missiles was developed by LarsCorp as a cheap and compact way of arming mining ships for protection. Most pilots still argued that ramming into the enemy fleet was more effective, but the missile launcher turned out to be good enough to be put on asteroid mining suits.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222332322=Tykes gain an anti-air missile barrage attack that deals damage in an area and additional damage to light units, but has a long cooldown.<n/><n/>These advanced cluster missiles were designed to shoot down small and evasive spy drones above Confederacy's key worlds. After technologies of detection and targeting systems improved, this technology was lost for a long time, up until it's rediscovery by pirates, who started trading old missile plans that were refitted for heavy infantry.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322233233=Phantoms gain the ability to toggle cloak. Doesn't cost or drain energy.<n/><n/>Spectre infantry cloaking fields are no longer capable of masking chaotic energies of phantoms. The best chance of them regaining invisibility are heavy vehicle cloaking fields developed by Blue Intel, as anything less potent will practically do nothing.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222332332=Structures rewired by Phantoms will also create a Psionic Spawn every 2 seconds.<n/><n/>Psionic rewiring only utilizes a power of the rewired structure's power reserves and reactors, the rest of the power usually is unused and wasted. Luckily there was an Umojan top-secret device meant to create their shadow guards into unstoppable soldiers by converting electric power of major Dominion reactors into psionic energy. The field test of it didn't happen as the transportship was intercepted by pirates, who are now selling the plans of the device.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223323322=Psionic Spawns and structures rewired by Phantoms will last 50% longer. Rewired structures will also only take 50% more damage rather than 100%.<n/><n/>This mental stabilizer was originally developed by Dominion to be used to subdue rogue operatives and spectres. While it was useful for it's intended purpose for a while, a certain event has shown that particularly powerful spectres such as phantoms would benefit from some mental stability and clarity of mind. An agent who recently went rogue still has a few of these and can sell them, so that mechanics reverse-engineer mental stabilizer plans for mass production.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223323323=Revenants gain the ability to kill a non-massive and non-heroic ground unit in melee range. Takedown 2 seconds and has no cost.<n/><n/>These takedowns become possible by using medical anaylzers made by CMI. Revenants just need to spot one weakpoint in the body or sometimes mechanisms of their foes to finish them quickly.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322233233232=Revenants gain 2 attack range and 0.75 movement speed. Revenant EMR will also gain 2 range and deal double damage to biological targets.<n/><n/>Wolfe Industries have developed mechanical protheses that allow their user to aim better and run faster. This means that the revenants will be able to not just shoot farther and run faster, but also aim for weaknesses in biological foes better.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222332332322=Revenants gain 1 energy regeneration and start with 50 more energy.<n/><n/>This compact reactor can be fitted onto revenant hostile enviroment suits. It can generate enough psionic energy to maintain cloak permanently, even if barely any energy will be generated for other uses while doing so.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322233234=Roadrunners and Roadblockers loose 60% of their maximum health, but take 75% less damage.<n/><n/>This revolutionary plating was designed for civil vehicles to make them more compact but also grant superior driver protection. It was never released commercially, because then repairing the vehicles would become too easy and unprofitable for their manufacturers, but it is still sold to military and paramilitary groups.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222332342=Roadrunners and Roadblockers will do additional 50% damage to biological targets with their weapons.<n/><n/>For some time, most weapon manufacturers forgot about the existence of white phosphorus and it's extensive use on conflicts on Earth. A few tests were run by ATVX, which involved deploying particles of the chemical while also firing a flamethrower. As it turned out it's still effective.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223323422=Roadrunners and Roadblockers will explode, dealing 50(50 vs light) damage in 2.5 radius to ground enemies on death.<n/><n/>All vehicle-mounted flamethrowers have a built-in safety mechanism, that prevents a napalm explosion from hitting nearby units if the vehicle is destroyed. An advanced AI can make this explosion harm hostiles and only prevent it on friendly units.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322233234222=Concentrators fire up to 2 additional missiles at hostile air targets near their main target.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222332342222=Concentrators will fire up to 2 additional missiles at hostile air targets near their main target.<n/><n/>While the safesky targeting system is effective, it's not as powerful as it could be when made by industry professionals. Wolfe Industries have already created a design that fires 66% more missiles than the old one.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223323422222=Concentrators gain 2 attack range.<n/><n/>This fuel used for Dominion spy jets can boost small missiles extremely well. Luckily, technology for producing it became purchasable since half of the government fleet went rogue.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322233234222222=Concentrators will fire twice every attack.<n/><n/>The original missile battery of concentrators had a pretty finicky firing and missile launching mechanism. It could only fire missiles either from the left or right battery. ATVX offer a fused firing system, which can fire missiles from 2 batteries each launch.

The ordnance mode will be much more stable, causing the tank shell to go deeper into the main target before exploding. The mobile cannon will cause a much more uncontrolled and premature explosion, which might even deal more damage than usual according to field tests.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223323422222222=Each attack of Insurgent Ordnance in Ordnance mode will make it deal 10 more damage to structures and massive units. Lasts 30 seconds and stacks up to 10 times.<n/>In Insurgent mode, the unit will passively deal 40% more damage to massive units and structures.<n/><n/>Initially developed for demolition, these explosive munitions were renamed to anarchist shells and sold to terrorist for their effectiveness at chaotic destruction of large targets, such as skyskrapers or docked battlecruisers. Each shell gets stronger from the heat generated by previous shells, making the next one more powerful. At some point the tank might overheat, that is why it's recommended to activate heat-limiting coolants when more than 10 shells are fired in a single go.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262322233234222222222=Deputies gain the ability to fold into a close-combat mode with a flamethrower weapon.<n/><n/>The old warbot models were made considering limitations of their time, including a much worse fuel. Nowadays two of the three main fuel tanks are not needed, because modern combustibles are a lot more effective. If some resources were invested into the research of alternative uses of them, it'd be possible to fill the fuel storage units with napalm instead and spray it through the built-in water jets.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222332342222222222=Deputies gain the ability to fold into a siege mode with a long-ranged anti-armored missile barrage.<n/><n/>By buying a modern compact navigation system, the old warbots will free up some space because the clunky sensors would be unnecessary anymore. Two custom missile launchers could be inserted in their place.

It folds itself into a more structurally stable and durable form. A lot of parts that previously were exposed to incoming attacks also become hidden by other mechanical limbs, theoretically allowing for repair welder arms to deploy and repair damaged plating while it is safe from harm. Some funds will be needed for researching these emergency repairs. 
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623222332342222222223=Magni gain 500 maximum shields and receive a 35% attack speed increase while the shields are active. Shields only regenerate at a rate of 40/s during Field Repair.<n/><n/>This shielding device developed by ATVX is incredibly powerful, however it can only be repaired by nanobots during large mech-wide repairs. A risky manuver magni drivers learned is overclocking the machinery and exposing core walker mechanisms to the outside for additional cooling while the shields are up for increased firepower.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326232223323422222222232=Magni gain the ability to blast a single target with beams of electricity, dealing 250 damage. Deals triple damage against shields and structures. Costs energy that is only regenerated in Field Repair.<n/><n/>The Magni reactors accumulate some unused energy during field repairs, which there might be a use for. Wolfe Industries have developed a set of connected electric coils, that theoretically could blast a single target with concentrated power a few times stronger than a lightning. This will take a bit of coordination, but supercomputers on Magni can certainly manage it in seconds while repairs are not taking place.

This might not always be the best result, as with a few modifications to MOOD AI it is possible to make it always change fuel consistency and location to ensure that enemies take maximum damage while allies don't get hurt.

Ability is available and cooldown only recharges while the Flagship is in  <c val="800080">Orbital Mode</c>.<n/><n/>We can already set up and deploy an orbital dock, which will construct and upkeep CAMAs. It will however need the Flagship to power the construction stations with it's reactor. All we need to send down CAMAs is Single-Trip Warp tech which will be implemented in the docks. Drop Barges will function as primitive warp gates.

Units cannot attack or be attacked while in orbit and can be called in and out of it every 25 seconds. <n/><n/>We can invent a Two-Way Warp system, where the ship itself acts as a warp gate to the other gate in the orbit. In the orbit itself, construction crews will be able to make dry docks that can be powered by flagship's reactor to repair the ships or just keep them out of danger.

They wouldn't be usable as frequently as quick jump engines of some capital ships, but would be way cheaper and sizable for any vessel.

Can land down and train additional CAMAs. Share multiple Flagship upgrades.<n/><n/>Our engineer team believes they can design an improved version of the minotaur-calss battlecruiser and make it buildable without special construction facilities. It would undoubtably be stronger than capital ships that preceded it and also would be big enough to fit a CAMA production facility inside of it.

Flagship can have up to 37 Onboard Stockpiles.<n/><n/>We can create a compact stockpile design that could be fit pretty much in any empty spot on the flagship. They will have a worse supply/mineral ratio than usual stockpiles, but also beef up the vessel.

Unlike the original weapon it  would also have measures that prevent space debris from going into the central shaft and breaking it beyond repairs.

We could even use the cheap material to make drop pods and ship hulls protected from burning up in the atmosphere for no additional cost.

Orbital Bombing costs 35 energy and launches down a 75 damage bomb at targeted area.

Area Lockdown designates a large area and every second fires a 25 damage plasma torpedo at every visible enemy inside of it. Area keeps being designated until the ability is cancelled.<n/>Area Lockdown costs 20 energy initially and 3 energy for every plasma torpedo. Can be redesignated every 5 seconds.<n/><n/>We can develop orbit to surface batteries, which would be more powerful and fire farther than usual ATS and ATA weapons. However, the sacrifice is them costing auxiliary power and having almost no way to be redirected. The entire ship will have to turn to designate a small area where these batteries will fire.

It's also not easy for dominion mining field deserters and those SCV drivers who were left jobless after raider and sometimes even our attacks.

Luckily, it's theoretically possible to drop down farm with spare seeds onto existing Stockpiles if an external storage unit, capable of preserving cargo even during orbital landing, is designed. It would be pretty great for defenses too.

Of course, the creature's sight, audition, olfaction and gustation must be removed to make it clueless about what is happening, using only touch to trigger certain instincts. A few tubes will also run through the creature, ensuring that it doesn't damage any exo-skeletons with the wrong acids.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326233233222=Allows construction of Remote Regulator on creep, which allows Artificial Larvae to morph into Impelled Impalers - long-ranged defense unit that deals well against slow units or groups of enemies.<n/><n/>Impalers are peculiar creatures. Their large tentacles constantly change length and twitch, to evade impassable underground terrain and perform an optimal attack, while also being quite fast and agile. Technology that can replicate that would be too expensive, nor will an artificial cerebral cortex work for how large it must be. If we attach controllers to certain muscles, without there being any physical tethers between them, we can remote regulate the main functions of the Impaler.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262332332222=Allows construction of Operating Room on creep, which allows Artificial Larvae to morph into Output Hosts - units that spawn free minions to attack instead of them.<n/><n/>While most people would say it is impossible to control every single locust of every Swarm Host we can have, there is a solution being thought of. We can alter the Swarm Host organs to produce enough magnesium for construction of exo and endo skeleton for each individual locust. However, such process is too complex to be coded into Artifical Larvae, thus we will need an Operating Room where scientists manually perform alterations on certain organs harvested from mid-metamorphosis Outpust Hosts.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623323322222=Allows construction of Biosteel Foundry on creep, which allows Artificial Larvae to morph into Bionic Overrunners - units that can rapid use powerful spells.<n/><n/>The unique properties of biosteel are too peculiar to ignore. If we were to use it's easy and flexible regeneration capabilities, a lot of new powers will become available. The Infestors typically spread zerg matter and organisms, but they could be easily redesigned to spread newly forged metals and create creatures out of them.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623323322223=Allows construction of Chemical Plant on creep, which allows Artificial Larvae to morph into Corrupt Hoaxers- units that channel a powerful stream of caustic acid every attack.<n/><n/>By researching advanced bodily fluids, we can replicate and improve some of the strongest substances produced by the zerg. By improving it's structure and adding a launch mechanism, corruptor caustic spray could become the most dangerous weapon in our possession.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326233233222232=Allows construction of Psionic Energy Reactor on creep, which allows Artificial Larvae to morph into Imposed Adders- units that can cast extremely powerful abilities at high energy costs.<n/><n/>Through using a recently discovered anomaly, we can create a powerful psionic reactor that will channel it's energy towards creatures based on zerg Vipers with a plethora of artifical organs used to redirect the psionic power.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262332332222322=Allows construction of Vanadium Machine Shop on creep, which allows Artificial Larvae to morph into Artilisks - Giant beasts that deal a lot of damage to ground units.<n/><n/>We need to be able to process the most advanced metal to restrain the zerg behemoths - Ultralisks. Unlike most creatures, the giant beasts are easily set frenzy and can destroy any apparatus while retaining their consciousness and seeking an authentic zerg hivemind. Only proper Vanadium exo and endo skeletons will keep the creatures obedient, while also being the most fitting material for upgrading their blades.

Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262333=Generates creep in small area around the Upsilon Science Complex.<n/><n/>Activates the creep injectors, which support existing creep samples in the complex. The samples were modified to be unable to spread naturally and survive, requiring specific substance injections to work. While this makes the creep easy to manipulate, it's movement will be heavily limited due to the injected substances not being spread far enough in time across the creep.

Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623342=Generates creep in an even larger area around the Upsilon Science Complex.<n/><n/>We can slightly upgrade the drones that spread feed creep and significantly overclock them. This will cause the creep to be slightly steaming and burning due to this, but the additional spread will overcompensate that.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE42332623343=Generates 1 additional Zerg Research every 2 seconds.<n/><n/>By setting up biological creep pumping systems, we can study it better. It seems to have a lot more hidden inside it's genetic code than we thought.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE423326233432=Generates 1 additional Zerg Research every 2 seconds.<n/><n/>We can create a tumor that sucks up creep intot he lower parts of the facility, the specimen storage, as it seems like the samples have peculiar reactions to creep  we can study.
Button/Tooltip/CalldownMULE4233262334322=Generates 1 additional Zerg Research every 2 seconds.<n/><n/>By creating psionic creep pumps we can easily amount exact quantities of it and see how certain aspects of it react with non-zerg animals and even certain human specimens.

Button/Tooltip/Land36=Become immobile, but gain life and shield regenerations and doubled detection and sight range.
Button/Tooltip/Land362=Jailer lifts higher into the sky, becomes immobile, looses missile weapons, but gains increased sight range and takes 30% less damage. Entering Overlook Mode takes 2 seconds, during which Jailer is stunned.
Button/Tooltip/Land3622=Gain increased Void energy from Nemesis's portal, allowing it to cast Lightning Breath in a large area around itself, dealing damage after a delay. Nemesis Of The Sky also takes 50% less damage, but moves 75% slower, when Void Concentration is in effect.
Button/Tooltip/Land3623=Disables Phantom Field, but after 5 seconds, Phantom Obelisk will start to fire missiles at a nearby enemy.
Button/Tooltip/Land36232=Disables Eternity Field, but after 5 seconds, Eternity Obelisk will start to fire healing missiles at nearby allies.
Button/Tooltip/Land37=Allows Inspirator Drone to increase speed of everything for all allied and owned units near it by 25%. Inspired units also provide Glory to Devil Mai, stacking at up to 96.<n/><n/>Inspiritors buff units every 5 seconds for 10 seconds.
Button/Tooltip/Land38=Roots Output Host, making it take 50% less damage and launch spawned creatures 150%, but loose the ability to move<n/>Using Root will stun the Output Host for 2 seconds and make it take triple damage for that duration.<n/><c val="ACACFF"><n/>Passive:</c>Output Hosts gain increased sight range.<n/><n/>Older iteration of the Swarm Host organisms used to require "rooting" - a process that allowed incubation of Locusts. It was fixed to be obsolete, but we can reintroduce it in a way, to reward more defensive and strategic positioning, where the Host's lower body gets disabled for maximum power of other functions as it doesn't need to reposition.
Button/Tooltip/Land382=Activates the lighters, turning Caustic Beam into Ignited Spray, which deals damage twice as fast and half of it in an area around target. If target has Caustic Liquid, it will loose 1 stack of it and deal 20 damage in an area.<n/><n/>If we make the Caustic Spray extremely flammable, it can be turned into a makeshift flamethrower with a flick of a lighter, or a set of them in front of Corrupt Hoaxer's fire resistant front carapace. This will also lead to a rapid explosion on foes who already were covered by spray.
Button/Tooltip/Land4=Lands the structure at a target location, allowing it to once again produce units, research upgrades, and use abilities.
Button/Tooltip/Land5=Permanently lands the science complex, allowing the 1st magnitude zerg research to begin.
Button/Tooltip/Land6=Lowers the ship, allowing it to warp in units and function as a resource drop-off point.
Button/Tooltip/Land62=Lands the Flagship into <c val="00FF00">Defense Mode</c>.<n/>While in <c val="00FF00">Defense Mode</c>, it is an immobile ground structure that acts as a resource drop-off point and worker producer. Also makes all unit production structures function 25% faster.
Button/Tooltip/Land622=Grounds the Drop Barge, granting it the ability to receive resources.
Button/Tooltip/Land6222=Lands the Colony Transport, allowing it to receive resources and train units.
Button/Tooltip/Land623=Lands the flagship.
Button/Tooltip/Land624=Flagship is in <c val="00FF00">Defense Mode</c>.<n/>It is an immobile ground structure that acts as a resource drop-off point and produces CAMAs.
Button/Tooltip/Land625=Lands the cruiser, making it receive resources and produce CAMAs.
Button/Tooltip/Land7=Land down.
Button/Tooltip/Land8=Lands the structure at a target location, allowing it to once again produce units, research upgrades, and use abilities.
Button/Tooltip/Larva2=Morphs into units.
Button/Tooltip/Larva22=Morphs into Zerg units.
Button/Tooltip/Larva222=Morphs into basic units.
Button/Tooltip/Larva2222=Morphs into units.
Button/Tooltip/Larva22222=Morphs into units.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3=Morphs into Zerg units.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32=Instead of taking damage, if Endolings have atleast 10 energy, they will ignore incoming damage, become stunned and invulnerable for 0.5 seconds. Endolings gain 50 energy and 1 energy regeneration.<n/><n/>Most of the endoling energy is wasted, as slight adjustments to the endoskeletons can make them just as efficient, without the need of use of creature's muscles. The energy generated for muscles can instead power a large battery, that will provide a powerful shield shroud for a short period of time if the creature senses incoming danger. It's notable that the battery shrouds the endoling, making it unable to move for it's short duration aswell.
Button/Tooltip/Larva322=On death, Endolings refund their cost.<n/><n/>It is possible to regain the research needed to produce Endolings by transmitting all a log of all of the expiriences their organism had while alive. While creating a new cerebrum to record all of them would be an obvious idea, a much simpler way is to redirect sensory neurons to an outside add-on, sending all the gathered data when no more data is being sent. The original cerebrum will be able to do bare minimum and keep the body from decaying.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3222=Endolings gain pernament cloak, can walk through non-Endoling units and gain 1 weapon range.<n/><n/>While the original zerglings are quite fast, it's possible to change the endoskeletons to be quite a lot sneakier, agile and able to hit enemies farther away through different movement capabilities. Of course, the actual body isn't meant to move or bend or extend the way endoskeletons can be made to, but it can still slowly regenerate tissue and function as armor for the mechanisms inside.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3223=Endolings gain 75% increased movement speed and 25% attack speed. Each attack further increases their attack speed further by 15% for 5 seconds, up to 5 times.<n/><n/>It is possible for servos to manipulate the endoling into performing attacks and movement alongside the endoskeleton, performing actions at optimal speeds.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32232=Endolings gain 50 health and 3 more armor.<n/><n/>If the right chemicals are injected into the right parts of Endoling veins, it is possible to inflate the armor and flesh at certain parts for additional protection.
Button/Tooltip/Larva322322=Endolings cost 1/3 less and morph in pairs.<n/><n/>The zerglings typically already morph in groups of  2, however it was previously too difficult to manipulate Artifical Larvae into morphing more than one. This can be undone by simplifying the creatures.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323=Contrived Queens' Quick Fix will heal additional 90 health over additional 15 seconds and it's healing will stack with itself indefinitely. Quick Fix and Contrived Queen attacks also will gain 3 range.<n/><n/>While Quick Fix already sends out smalll bots that will repair and heal detected damages and wounds, their design and AI is limiting. A new design has been proposed, based on how zerg creep works and spreads. The drones will be much smaller and more agile, allowing them to fly and heal for longer, as well as complete their tasks alongside other nanobots from another batch. Fitting Contrived Queens with the more compact drones will make space for precision improvements as well.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232=Contrived Queens gain 33% increased energy regeneration and the ability to kill a friendly unit to spawn an owned unit, that has 75% faster cooldown rate, 125% attack speed, 50% incoming damage reduction, 25% speed bonus and 35% damage bonus, however, it has a 60 second timed life. Costs 20 energy and has a 10 second cooldown.<n/><n/>By studying Zerg changelings, it is possible to create a formula for a solution, capable of tearing apart and rearranging matter. The newly recreated being has part of it's mind still loyal to allies. However, it does slowly collapse due to even minimal gravity.<n/>Further study of this is required, but we can already use it to our advantage.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32322=Contrived Queens gain 0.5 speed, 30 health, cost 10 less research. Their attacks also will bounce to 2 additional targets, dealing half as much damage.<n/><n/>While we don't have enough Hydralisk samples to construct them, we can use certain similar parts of Queen dna to recreate them as close as possible, as both creatures share a plethora of similarities. However, use of both creatures is impossible due to Artifical Larvae-related limitations. We also won't be able to add other major improvements to the Contrived Queens.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323=Constrained Devastator's Ignite Bile will launch 4 additional projectiles with different offsets, dealing half of damage of Ignited Bile to a single enemy.<n/><n/>We can implement industrial flamethrowers into the organ containing corrosive bile. By slightly delaying and burning all substances in the Devastator, it is possible to launch additional smaller projectiles. Now, this will most likely cause immeasurable pain and burn the limb muscles to the point of creature's legs not working, but it won't affect the exoskeleton moving the legs.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232=Constrained Devastator's Ignite Bile will launch 3 additional projectiles over 1.5 seconds, each dealing 1/5 of the Inginited Bile's damage and slowing targets by 20% for 10 seconds. Bonus projectile explosion radius is smaller by 25%. Stacks up to 4 times.<n/><n/>Ravagers typically stop producing corrosive bile after launching it, to ensure that no important organs get burned. However, if this mechanism is prevented, a few slightly ignited projectiles can be launch, dealing less damage but also slowing enemies. While some bile-producing organs will be damaged by this, we cause the body to grow additional chambers in the legs, which aren't used because of the exoskeleton anyway. <n/><n/>
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232322=Constrained Devastator's Ignite Bile will also launch another Bile into the air. After 1.5 seconds, it will fall exactly where the ability was targeted, dealing the same damage in the same radius as Ignited Bile, but also damaging air units.<n/><n/>Typically, Ravegers launch corrosive biles into the air, but it is too hard to force a coordinated strike via the exoskeleton. However, if a synthetic brain and navigator replaces Constrained Devastator's leg muscles, we can launch surgical and precise strikes.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323=Bionic Overrunners gain the ability to tether a unit for 30 seconds. Whenever a tethered unit takes damage, all other tethered units take that damage.<n/>Costs 15 energy, has 3 charges and 4 second charge cooldown.<n/><n/>Some things align with others. One of our expelled scientists has been theorizing about something he calls "the Lines". Allegedly, influencing any object would cause the same to another object anywhere. It could've been a single atom getting pushed when a cup got pushed or an entire galaxy splitting in half when twig was stepped on. We aren't completely sure ourselves, but some of his old schematics for a prototype weapon can be now used. Typically it would destroy all matter it was on, but bio-steel can just regenerate quickly enough. It can "tether beings by creating artificial Lines".
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323232=Bionic Overrunners gain the ability to instantly kill an enemy unit, but creates 2 copies of it belonging for the enemy. The copies have halved health, cooldown rate and take double damage.<n/>Costs 20 energy and has 1 second cooldown.<n/><n/>Through most advanced bionics, we have made a formula for biosteel, capable of replicating a complex organism or machinery. Sadly, it leeches most of the original and generally causes long term damage. However, we can still use it to "split" opponents into 2 weaker versions of them.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232322=Bionic Overrunners gain the ability to cause enemy units and structures within a targeted area to grant vision for 30 seconds and take additional 10 damage from incoming damage sources. Has unlimited range.<n/>Costs 50 energy and has a 2 second cooldown.<n/><n/>The Panoptes Drone System was the original design for a planet-wide scanner device, capable of detecting foes anywhere. While it turned out to be too expensive and inefficient, we have come back to the concept. By creating an artificial psionic energy generator, the Bionic Overrunners can create psionic biosteel drones instantly, around a target.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232323=Artilisks gain the ability to teleport to a random enemy in a targeted area and gain 200% attack speed, 100% movement speed, 100% life leeched from dealing damage and 75% incoming damage reduction for 2 seconds. After 2 seconds, teleports to another enemy.<n/>Teleports to 5 enemies over 10 seconds.<n/><n/>We have found a peculiar specimen that has crashlanded on Castanar. Most of the space station it was on has been destroyed, but the creature survived and kept striding through the planet for months. We couldn't contain it, dead or alive, as it would out-regenerate and teleport away from any incoming attacks. We did get to quickly blast out some of it's organs, that can pretty much reproduce themselves forever. By inserting them into Ultralisks and occasionally connecting them to the organism, we can make the beast unstoppable and grant it teleportation abilities..
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323232=Artilisks will deal 500% bonus damage to light units and heal for 25% of damage dealt to any enemies.<n/><n/>By adding rockets to all of Ultralisk blades, they can get activated to cut through any light material almost instantly. While each attack would theoretically and practically break bones and muscles of the creature, we can add material recycler systems that mend the wounds.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323232322=Artilisks gain the ability to launch a missile at an air target, dealing 20 area damage. Contains 15 charges.<n/><n/>We can replace the Ultralisk spine with a lot more compact vanadium contraption, granting space for a missile battery that automatically grows rockets mainly out of bodily fluids and regenerative biosteel.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232323222=Artilisks gain the ability to roar, getting stunned for 2 seconds but granting nearby allies 35% life steal, 25% movement and attack speeds and 3 armor for 12 seconds.<n/><n/>Ultralisk roars always struck fear and doubt in their opponents, however it seems like there was always a secondary purpose to them. Certain broods have grown a set of symbiotic creatures inside of them, being released to slightly improve the zerg forces. We can heavily modify the creatures to boost allies around Artilisks.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323233=Artilisks gain the ability to push ground enemies in a large area towards them and stun them for a second.<n/><n/>We can attach an advanced device that creates earthquakes, forming shallow sinkholes that push enemies on the surface onto the beast.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323232332=Artilisks will tranquilize opponents near them. They also gain an ability to launch a penetrating Tranquilizer Wave.<n/>Enemies that are tranquilized get stunned if they don't take damage for 4 seconds. Tranquilizers last 20 seconds.<n/><n/>We have developed a gas capable of severely weakening mechanisms and putting most creatures to sleep, however it is easily pushed away by even the slightest movement. Of course, organisms affected by it will also have their survival instincts overwhelm the effectiveness of the substance for a few moments. By replacing some muscles of Ultralisks with tranquilizer glands and storage sacs, they will radiate nearby units with it, as well as gain the ability to occasionally release large amounts of gas towards an area.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323233=Bionic Overrunners gain the ability to permanently take control of a target enemy unit or structure.<n/>Costs 25 energy and has a 2 second cooldown.<n/><n/>Instead of creating single neural parasite, it would be more efficient to make small swarms of reproducing creatures from bio-steel. Anything they can't control will get hacked the conventional way.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232332=Bionic Overrunners gain the ability to cause non-heroic enemy units in a targeted area to gain 200% attack speed, become unselectable and uncommandable and start attacking each other for 5 seconds.<n/>Costs 75 energy and has a 2 second cooldown.<n/><n/>Zerg scourge used to have a variety of strains, however, almost all of them shared the features of suicidal attacks. We can grow similar creatures inside of Bionic Overrunners, however, they would spend all of their intestines and energy to shortly annoy and confuse opponents. Their close position to enemies will also allow us to scan and hack the firing mechanisms of different automatic weapons.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323322=Targeted unit will take 50% more damage and deal 35 damage on death to nearby enemies. Lasts 15 seconds.<n/>Costs 35 energy and has a 3 second cooldown.<n/><n/>Recent research has show a use for swarms of biosteel nanobots: by overloading and overclocking inner systems of mechs and causing organisms to rapidly mutate acid glands, we can cause vile explosions upon opponents reaching a critical point. The alteration to their inner workings will also make their structure much more vulnerable and the critical state a lot closer than it used to be.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232333=Allows construction of Ethereal Bunkers - structures, which ground units can enter to gain 2 range, 50% attack speed and 10 life regeneration.<n/>Every 10 seconds, units inside Ethereal Bunkers will create a copy of themselves that has 30 second timed life. Copies take triple damage, attack 50% slower, have less ranged weapon range, but move 1 speed faster and will automatically seek out nearest enemies.<n/><n/>The science team has an extensive database of Changeling specimens. Through heavily modifying some of the creatures' substances, it is possible to create near perfect replicas of objects and organisms with it. By redesigning old bunker models to have a small chemical plant inside of them, a possibility of armies consisting out of replicants arises.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323332=All mercenary units on creep will gain 5 life regeneration, 75% attack speed, 50% movement speed.<n/><n/>The science team has developed a special chemical which causes nearby creep to quickly spread onto a surface. By covering armor of mercenaries with it, we can make creep slightly cover and enhance them.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323233322=All mercenary units will grant Zerg Research on death, equal to double of their supply cost.<n/><n/>We can secretly inject some zerg genes into mercenaries and see how they will react. All the data of these suprise experiments will be gathered upon the death of the soldiers.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232333222=All mercenary units gain an upgraded attack:<n/>Atlas Guard rifles and Blockade Runner attacks will bounce 2 times for halved damage.<n/>Penetration Divisions, Leonidas Company anti-air weapon and Sky Watcher Sky Watch will fire 50% more missiles.<n/>Every attack, Tiangou Divisions and Mainland Hunters will gain 20% attack speed for 20 seconds, stacks up to 5 times.<n/>Saint Troopers and Ravager Gang Dropships become cloaked.<n/>Ravager Paratroopers attack 35% faster.<n/><n/>We can use certain zerg offensive organs and slightly alter them to work as a replacement or addition to mercenary weapons. These guns will run on the same fuel source as the rest of troop suit and vehicle mechanisms.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323332222=All mercenary units gain an upgrad to their armor:<n/>Tiangou Divisions and Blockade Alphas will launch a 10 damage missile at whoever damages them.<n/>Atlas Guards, Mainland Hunters and Leonidas Companies convert 25% of dealt damage into health.<n/>Saint Troopers, Ravager Gang Dropships gain 3 armor.<n/>Sky Watchers and Penetration Divisions gain 50 energy, slow energy regeneration and will block incoming damage for 10 energy.<n/>Ravager Paratroopers will gain invulnerability for 6 seconds and doubled attack speed instead of dying and then die afterwards.<n/><n/>By incorporating tissue assimilation, spine response, heavy carapace, rapid evasion and emergency adrenaline organs into the mercenary troops, they can be significantly improved.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323332223=Atlas Guards, Saint Troopers, Tiangou Divisions, Mainland Hunters, Leonidas Companies and Penetration Divisions gain 50% movement speed, 1 weapon range and the ability to start flying.<n/>While flying, they are considered an air unit and can fly over cliffs.<n/>Can be toggled on and off.<n/><n/>By secretly adding certain zerg flyer genes, metabolic boosters and other substances into the supplies, we can secretly turn our troops into half-zerg flying monstrosities. The mech pilots will have to grow organs and wings into the machinery itself and become one.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323233322232=All mercenary production structures gain alternate unit creation ability, which will make units that will cost no minerals, vespene and will be built 20 seconds faster, but will cost 1 Zerg Research for every 10 minerals and 5 vespene they usually cost. These units also will take 25% less damage.<n/><n/>We have perfected the changeling-based ethereal substance. It can now clone any mercenary trooper perfectly and it won't fall apart over time. The only downside is that the copies are too accurate and will also need the supplies. And probably commit suicide if they learn they are copies, but that shouldn't happen.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232333223=Trafficked Workers gain the ability to enter any zerg tech structure. While inside, they generate 1 Zerg Research every 5 seconds.<n/>1st Operation Magnitude structures can hold up to 2 Trafficked Workers<n/>2nd Operation Magnitude structures can hold up to 3 Trafficked Workers<n/>3rd Operation Magnitude structures can hold up to 5 Trafficked Workers<n/><n/>It's fascinating how zerg swarm can assimilate and improve other creatures into itself. We have developed a similar process, involving an artifical parasite that contains exact replica of memories, knowledge and thinking of our greatest scientists. When attached to a person's head, it should assimilate the cerebral cortex and transfer a scientist mind onto it's host.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323333=Allows Upsilon Science Complex to deploy a Creep Sprinkler anywhere on the map - small building that creates creep, but  costs 4 supplies.<n/><n/>We can black mail the Kelmorian Anti-Infestation Research Center to create experimental creep sprinklers that would turn food and fuel into substances needed for spreading creep. They already have a vast encrypted database that should suffice for designing such technology. We just need to hire people that can dig up dirt on them.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323233332=Allows Upsilon Science Complex to deploy a Hive Mind Radiator anywhere on the map - a small building that can automatically take control of hostile units, but costs Zerg Research.<n/><n/>Through bribing a local Dominion military force in Tyrador system, we can retrieve remains of a Hive Mind Emulator left on Tyrador VIII by Raynor's Raiders, a device that can project artificial hive mind. While we have similar technology, it seems like unique zerg specimens have lead to the terrorist group having components that are not available to us.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232333322=All zerg units will repair themselves, healing 200 hp/s when out of combat for 5 seconds.<n/><n/>The Central Terran Foundry is going bankrupt, despite having the most advanced technologies in the business. No leaks of how it works were ever made, however now all the designs being sold for cheap just to keep the company alive. We can take advantage of this to melt metal and use it to heal zerg wounds.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323333222=All zerg units gain a barrier, when morphed. The barrier cannot be healed.<n/>1st Magnitude Operation units gain 75 shield barrier.<n/>2nd Magnitude Operation units gain 150 shield barrier.<n/>3rdd Magnitude Operation units gain 225 shield barrier.<n/><n/>As it turns out, Umojans used to develop a final solution to fighting zerg - tight forcefields that will cover all cocoons of the creatures, forcing them to drown or die of starvation, being unable to hatch. If we provide witness protection to a scientist of theirs, he can lend us some of those forcefield plans to protect the newly hatched zerg. Sadly, a device to recharge the shields isn't something they saw the need of developing, which lead to a lot of fatalities in an accident involving the use of technology to hatch stronger creatures.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323233332222=Zerg units will split into Endolings on death.<n/>1st Magnitude Operation units(except for Endolings) will create 1 Endoling.<n/>2nd Magnitude Operation units will create 2 Endolings.<n/>3rd Magnitude Operation units will create 5 Endolings.<n/><n/>We can rehire some of the scientists, that managed to escape from us. A few of these people can finish contrived incubation chamber designs. Right after the system is perfected, we get rid of traitors once and for all.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232333322222=Allows Upsilon Science Complex to construct a Minor Research Lab on creep - structure that automatically grants 1 Zerg Research every 3 seconds, but costs a lot of vespene and takes up 10 supplies.<n/><n/>Hiring independent scientist teams is quite difficult, as most of them are extremely secretive. Still, an organization is ready to link us to them for as long as supplies and fuel for arrival here is provided. Most of these people are refugees or runaways, but they are still extremely qualified for the job.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323333222222=Allows calldown of 2 Grease Donkeys at Mercenary Centers - mineral miners that can also function as a mineral drop-off points.<n/><n/>We can hire Dominion refugees to work a job of hauling resources and operating unsafe creatures based on Drone dna for increased mineral gathering efficiency.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232323333223=All zerg units Zerg Research cost will be reduced by 20%, then by 5.<n/><n/>We can hire expert managers and recruit more scientists to significantly improve the difficult and required knowledge in creating more zerg.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232324=When targeting a unit with more than 5 stacks of Caustic Liquid, all units in 3 radius around the Caustic Beam's target will gain a stack of Caustic Liquid. Doesn't spread further or create puddles on units around the target.<n/><n/>By altering the formula of caustic acid, we can make it's structure harden in a way that allows some of it to bounce off and spray to nearby targets. The new formula will also spread over it's target better, meaning no efficiency will be sacrificed by deflecting additional liquid.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323242=Corrupt Hoaxers channel a spray of heavily pressurized acid rather than attacking. The spray deals damage every 0.5 seconds and adds a stack of Caustic Liquid, which reduces movement and attack speed by 7%, shield and life armors by 1 for every stack, up to 10 stacks and lasts 20 seconds. Caustic Spray can retarget once every 5 seconds.<n/><n/>If the Caustic Beam is targeting unit with 10 stacks of Caustic Liquid, it will create a small puddle of acid, which grows over 5 seconds and lasts additional 5 seconds after that. Units in the puddle take 5 damage every second and their cooldowns refresh 80% slower.<n/><n/>While the acid is meant to completely cover it's target, at some point there is just nowhere else to stick to, leaving it to slowly spread over the ground. 
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323243=Corrupt Hoaxers gain the ability to activate and deactivate internal lighters, which will ignite the Caustic Beam. When ignited, it deals damage twice faster and halved damage to enemies in an area around the target. If main target of Ignited Spray has Caustic Liquid, it will loose 1 stack and deal 20 damage around it every time the Ignited Spray damages it..<n/><n/>If we make the Caustic Spray extremely flammable, it can be turned into a makeshift flamethrower with a flick of a lighter, or a set of them in front of Corrupt Hoaxer's fire resistant front carapace. This will also lead to a rapid explosion on foes who already were covered by spray.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232432=Caustic Puddles will fire projectiles at 3 closest enemies in range of 5 every second. Projectiles remove 3% of their targets' max health and shields and deal 5 damage.<n/><n/>By using Swarm Host dna, we can grow small larvae in an artifical organ of Corrupt Hoaxers, then launch them in the Caustic Beam. The small creatures can quickly grow in a puddle. The lifespan of the formed creatures is made to be quite short, as there is no way to control them, but we can still slightly influence what they see as enemies and allies. Caustic Locusts will use small portions of extremely viscous substances to live, spraying them all over the opponents they see and fly into.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232324322=Caustic Liquid will last 50% longer.<n/><n/>We can enhance the caustic liquid to stick to any surface much longer.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323243222=When Corrupt Hoaxers stop channeling Caustic Beam, they create an invulnerable phantom that channels the beam for 3 additional seconds.<n/><n/>We recently invented an ethereal substance based on Changelings, which can replicate different organisms for a short duration. By filling it into Corrupt Hoaxer skeletal structure through changing gases produced by the flight organs during the channeling of Caustic Beam, we can create a basic replica of the creatures, however it will have a shorter lifespan, lasting even less than other ethereal beings.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232432222=When Corrupt Hoaxers start channeling Caustic Beam, they also create a Caustic Puddle. Occurs no matter how many stacks of Caustic Liquid their targets have.<n/><n/>By storing additional caustic substance in special sacs on Corrupt Hoaxers, it's possible to release a large burst of it whenever they start attacking.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232324323=Imposed Adders gain the ability that creates a cloud that slows movement speed and prevents enemy units and structures from using energy-based abilities and seeing for 10 seconds. The cloud also has a Blight Totem in the middle of it, which automatically drags enemies into the cloud during it's duration.<n/><n/>One of Vipers' organs has the unique ability to drag enemies of similar or even large sizes straight to the Viper and another one can create clouds that significantly weaken opponents. Using advanced technologies, we can vaporize the abduction organ and recreate it with the cloud particles.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323243232=Imposed Adders gain the ability to cause enemies in a large radius around the creature to get knocked away, take 40 damage and stunned for 3 seconds.<n/><n/>The crew has recently developed a design for a custom doomsday device. It would release psionic energy and kinetic force, radiating towards a surface. The result would be massive earthquakes and flattening of anything on the planet or space station. If designed, a smaller version of it could be attached to Imposed Adders.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232432322=Imposed Adders gain the ability to unleash a slow, traveling fire wall, which deals 160 damage to enemies inside of it every second. Moves up to 50 range away and has 2 speed.<n/>Does not damage structures.<n/><n/>We can make certain Viper organs produce bile that burns brighter than any other fluid while also lasting much longer. It is possible to also launch it forward by creating a swarm of basic, small creatures that carry the liquid.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232324323222=Imposed Adders gain the ability to make a targeted unit takes 30% of it's current health and 100% of it's current shields as damage and looses all energy.<n/><n/>We learned how to ruin atomic structure of outer layer of any object. It typically isn't lethal, but can physically ruin them. The apparatus performing this also causes a small electromagnetic pulse as a side effect.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323243232222=Imposed Adders gain the ability to teleport them and all nearby allied or owned units to targeted friendly units. After teleporting, all units gain a barrier that absorbs up to 75 damage for 5 seconds, which also grants 25% movement and attack speeds.<n/><n/>The ability to teleport, while most often contributed to Protoss, was rarely used by the Zerg Swarm to transfer enormous armies through an opened vortex. We can still find traces of it in their genetic codes. While ineffective in the middle of a planet, a creature can be used as a beacon to bring nearby units to the Warp Space as an almost instant vortex. Upon leaving the space, anomaly has been documented to slightly accelerate and protect them.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232432322222=Imposed Adders gain the ability to siphon minerals from an enemy structure, dealing 20 damage and generating 10 minerals every second.<n/><n/>By deconstructing a building via clusters of precise beams and sending them to different scrapyards, we can quickly boost our economy.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323232432323=Imposed Adders gain the ability to cause enemies in a large radius around the creature to get knocked away, take 40 damage and stunned for 3 seconds.<n/><n/>The crew has recently developed a design for a custom doomsday device. It would release psionic energy and kinetic force, radiating towards a surface. The result would be massive earthquakes and flattening of anything on the planet or space station. If designed, a smaller version of it could be attached to Imposed Adders.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323233=Every attack of Constrained Devastators become invulnerable for 0.5 seconds and heal 10 health.<n/><n/>Each weak attack, Ravagers waste a bit of corrosive bile. If all the wasted substance is collected and redirected, it can be used to power a forcefield.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232332=Constrained Devastators' Ignited Bile deals 10 more damage(40 more to structures) and flies 4 range farther.<n/><n/>If we replace corrosive bile with contrived gases, we can make it much lighter and deadly. Of course, the Ravager will become unable to digest food by itself, but, if life extension is needed, needed substances can be injected.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323322=Constrained Devastators' Ignite Bile will recharge 25% faster.<n/><n/>We can replicate the formula for corrosive bile almost perfectly, allowing us to add a few compat generators to the Constrained Devastators.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323234=When burrowed, Impelled Impalers' attacks will instead resurface multiple smaller spines over a few seconds with large random offset. The longer it fires, the more spines will be surfacing.<n/><n/>We were too busy considering how to control Impaler natural attacks that we never though of why stop them. Impelled Impalers are a mix of Lurker and Impaler dna samples, making their non-regulated attack unpredictable and confused. In theory, the tentacles will split themselves multiple times when burrowed and tangle while trying to surface under enemies, Spines will appear rapidly and uncontrollably from the ground. however a massive tentacle growing and management tumor-like organ will grow on the creature's head by itself.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232342=When not burrowed, Impelled Impaler attacks will launch a wave of spines, slowly moving forward and dealing damage to enemies along the way.<n/><n/>While the blade of the tentacles typically only surfaces, when under an enemy, superheated cluster of them can be put on a secondary tentacle. The tentacle will be a lot slower due to the pure weight of the blades, but they will cut through anything in the way.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323422=Impelled Impaler burrow is replaced by flight. While flying, Impelled Impalers cannot move and gain a longer range Mass Resurface which occurs instantly.<n/><n/>The tentacles already are remote controlled, so if we allow them to completely seperate from an Impaler nothing much would change, however the blades would still need to be near the creature as the central data reciever won't fit in the assault organ. We can utilize this to allow Impelled Impalers to fly through addition of a basic symbiotic organism that can produce gases to lift both creatures in the air.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323423=Every time Impelled Impalers damage a unit, they get stunned for 1 second.<n/><n/>Through drug injection, Impaler tentacles become capable of using much heavier blades that are designed to penetrate and impale enemies completely.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323234232=Every second, Impelled Impalers will fire up to 4 spines at air enemies in 12 radius, dealing 20(10 bonus to armored) each. All of Impelled Impaler attacks also will deal double damage to Massive units.<n/><n/>Using the few Hydralisk samples we have, it's possible to enhance Impelled Impalers by adding a spine-generating organ that will replace some of the tentacle blade generation. The spines can be launched by special apparatus on the head of the creature. The spines and blade structure will become less sound and break when impaling or piercing enemies, but it means that, in large opponents, parts of attacks will get stuck, scatter and deal even more damage.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232342322=Impelled Impalers move, attack and burrow 30% faster.<n/><n/>We can overclock the muscle controllers without dealing any significant damage to the Impaler capabilities, although a thin endoskeleton will be inserted in case something goes haywire because of it.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323234233=Every attack, Impelled Impalers send out an underground tentacle that eventually reaches the original position of their targets, dealing damage in an area.<n/><n/>While burrowed, tentacles travel faster and deal damage in a large area.<n/><n/>There are no reasons to believe that a zerg brood has ever used both Impalers and Lurkers. For shame, as forcing a little combination of the two is quite lethal.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323424=Output Hosts will spawn Blisters instead of Keds. Blisters are extremely similar to Keds, until they suffer critical damage. Once fatal damage is taken, the creature will gain a 30 health shield, 50% movement speed buff and an anti-ground 15 damage suicide melee attack. <n/>On time out or death, Blisters deal 25 damage to ground units in a large radius.<n/><n/>We have found samples of a peculiar zerg creature in a traveling brood. It was similar to locusts, but would've produced deadly acid by melting all of it's muscles and bones, then explode and spray it to nearby creatures. The weird thing is, genetic structure of that one sample was nothing swarm-like: it was a lot more rapid and chaotic, as if designed on "the fly". We can easily improve on the concept, allowing it to attack normally until death, only then quickly turn most of organs into acid. At that point, the flesh will also get artificially inflated for extra protection and acid-resistant endoskeleton will become the independant way of movement.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323234242=Output Hosts will spawn Bombardiers instead of Keds. They are similar to Keds, however Bombardiers gain 5 attack range against ground and 8 against air enemies, deal double damage and their attacks splash(splash radius is heavily increased for anti-air attacks), but attack cooldown is increased by 50%, movement speed is reduced by 0.5 and all of their projectiles are dodgeable.<n/><n/>This one is based on a locust strain that seemed abstract. One of our sponsors in the Dominion has provided us with a peculiar Locust sample from the chamber of zerg Swarm's Evolution Master. It's been designed to automatically go for nearest enemy bases and was only adapted for Earth-like gravity. A miniature bile launcher was added to it at some point, granting a powerful siege option. We can easily grant this feature to current Keds, as well as use some genetic code from original Bile Launcher samples to make them ever stronger against air targets.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232342422=Output Hosts will spawn Gadflies instead of Keds. They are similar to Keds, however Gadflies are flying, move 50% faster, attack 30% faster and have increased vision range.<n/><n/>While winged locusts aren't anything rare for zerg broods and certain terran outposts are filled with their remains, it still seems hard to believe how easily zerg can attach wings, floating gas chambers and pinions to their creatures. The science team certainly is considering all of the ways we can use this knowledge to our favor. Besides that, the more aerodynamic bone structure allows locusts to be more agile, which can be used to improve bodily functions.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323234243=Output Hosts gain the ability to unearth 5 Keds in an area with 10 second timed life. Keds will be replaced with other locust-like creatures, if other upgrades replace them. Has a 60 second cooldown. Also increases duration of main groups of spawns by 5 seconds.<n/><n/>Occasionally, we can have Outpust Hosts "lay" an auto-burrowing egg cluster into the ground by extending a large tube through it's body. The eggs will have an exoskeleton, capable of moving them quickly through the ground to an area. After that, it transforms itself into locust endoskeleton and hatches them. Sadly, the keds made this way won't last as long. In addition to this, we can slow metabolism but overclock endoskeletons of all spawned creatures to increase the life span without harming anything else.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3232342432=Output Hosts gain the ability Root, becoming immobile, taking 50% less damage and launching spawns 150% faster. Whenever the root is activated or deactivated, Output Hosts are stunned for 2 seconds and take triple damage. Output Hosts will also passively gain increased sight range.<n/><n/>Older iteration of the Swarm Host organisms used to require "rooting" - a process that allowed incubation of Locusts. It was fixed to be obsolete, but we can reintroduce it in a way, to reward more defensive and strategic positioning, where the Host's lower body gets disabled for maximum power of other functions as it doesn't need to reposition.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32323424322=On death, all Output Host spawns will heal nearby friendly units for 25 health and additional 25 over 25 seconds. Can stack.<n/><n/>If some of the fluids that locust-like creatures produce throughout their short lives are stored in the exoskeletons, we can recycle it into special micro organism-filled liquid, that can patch mechanical and organic matter.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323234244=Outpost Hosts every attack release 3 Keds with 15 second timed lives, 60 health and 15 damage attack that occurs every 1.2 seconds. Attacks have a 20 second cooldown.<n/>Upgrades can replace Keds with their alternatives.<n/><n/>Every Swarm Host has thousands of little larvae living inside of it, being prepared to grow once the broodmother needs it. For the longest time we thought we couldn't manage and control this creature. However, after a few experiments, the science team has found out that larvae can be independent and survive naturally on the host while in early life stages. To arm each Locust with endo and exo skeletons, we have heavily altered some organs on the Host to produce Magnesium in large quantities. Delicate devices with a vast storage of microchips and batteries quickly unite the magnesium mechanisms on the locust during metamorphosis. The hard to replicate parts needed for this process still must be delivered through small drones every now and then.
Button/Tooltip/Larva3233=Contrived Queens gain 20% attack speed. Every third attack, they heal a nearby friendly unit in 7 range with the lowest health for 45 life.<n/><n/>For launching their attacks, Contrived Queens apply extreme pressure to them by filling the talon chamber with liquid, that quickly hardens to prevent it from flowing away. Another acid is used to quickly melt the hardened solution. By applying electricity, the substance can be melted quickly and used for another talon faster. A part of liquid generated for each attack can also be sprayed at nearby allies to cover their wounds.
Button/Tooltip/Larva32332=Contrived Queens gain 2 armor and the ability to cover a friendly unit in a barrier, that makes them take 90% less damage, but also do causes them to do everything 25% slower. Barrier can absorb up to 200 damage, it has no other ways of being removed. Can auto-cast on units with less than 10% health.<n/><n/>We have found an unused capability zerg Queens had - covering an organism in a thick layer of some sort of substances produced through their psionic powers. We can add a psi simulator to allow them to use it as a mechanism for saving allies from incoming damage.
Button/Tooltip/Larva323322=Contrived Queens gain 4 attack damage and the ability to launch a spinal disc, which will instantly cause an enemy to take 20 damage and 50% increased damage from all sources for 10 seconds. Costs no energy but has a 45 second cooldown. Is on auto-cast by default.<n/><n/>There are traces of an unused Queen trait in their DNA, which would've made them more combat focsed, but also a lot less intelligent. It would've also had a secondary attack that covers enemies in acid, causing their defenses to melt and weaken. We can sacrifice other possible capabilities of the Contrived Queens to recreate that feature.
