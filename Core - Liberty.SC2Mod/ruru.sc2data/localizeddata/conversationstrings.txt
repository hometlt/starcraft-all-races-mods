Conversation/AICommunication/Line00073=We are probing the enemy for weakness.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00074=The Swarm is returning to base. We're taking too many losses.

Conversation/Tutorial/Line00063=Для многих приказов назначены горячие клавиши. Вместо того чтобы отдавать приказ нажатием кнопки на панели приказов, вы можете просто нажать нужную клавишу на клавиатуре. /// Many commands on the command card have a "hotkey". Rather than select the button using your mouse, you can order the unit to perform the command by hitting the appropriate key on your keyboard.

Use your units to search the map for the enemy. If you learn what the enemy is building you can train units that are more effective against the enemy force.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00066=В ходе разведки вы можете обнаружить новые базы противника. Проводите разведку как можно чаще. Используйте для этого быстрые и недорогие единицы вроде КСМ, зондов или рабочих, потеря которых не скажется на исходе боя. /// Scouting can also reveal areas where the enemy has set up new bases. Scout frequently so your information is up to date, and use fast and inexpensive units like SCVs, Probes or Drones so you lose little if your scout is destroyed.
