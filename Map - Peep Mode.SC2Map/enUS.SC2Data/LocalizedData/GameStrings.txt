Several other players bet on the opposing team.  At the end of the match, the total pot is 1,200 (300 from Nancy and Sally, and 900 from various other players).  Since Nancy bet twice as much as Sally, Nancy will receive twice as many Chips in return: Nancy gets 800, Sally gets 400.  All other players lose all Chips they bet.<n/><n/>Every player is rewarded with 100 Chips after every match.  Match participants get an additional 200 Chips (bringing their total earned to 300), and match winners receive an additional 700 (bringing their total earned to 1,000).

Param/Value/27B7158C=- When disengaging the Auto Cam while it is panning to a new target, it may take up to a second for manual control to be returned to the player.  Fixes are being explored.<n/><n/>- Observers may not select certain combination of units while observing matches.  This is due to limitations with Blizzard's alliance engine as well as security measures to ensure no observer control.<n/><n/>- Chatting to Real ID friends is initiated in-game via the standard chat interface.  Blizzard does not expose the source/destination of a chat message, so any initial chat messages will be seen by other players in normal chat.  Once a conversation is initiated with a Real ID friend in this fashion, simply use the Social UI found in the lower-right portion of your screen instead of the in-game chat.  It is recommended to use nonsense phrases like "asdf" to initiate Real ID chats, therefore.

This means that each of these players could potentially be picked by the system to play in the next match.

Param/Value/42869E69=The Leaderboard provides information about local and global player stats.  It can be opened by clicking on the small "crown" button found in the upper left portion of the screen.  Currently the columns provided are Peep Rating, League (if specified), Race, Wins, and Chips (see below).  Detailed player profiles can be obtained by rolling your mouse cursor over a player name.  Players can also be ranked by clicking on a column header to re-sort the list by that column.<n/><n/>Peep Rating: The rating system used in PeepMode is based on the Sonas system used in Chess tournaments.  Ratings change during each 1v1 or 2v2 match and carry from game to game.<n/><n/>League: Each player can specify his/her league at any time by choosing the appropriate selection from the dropdown menu found near the bottom of  the Team Selection window.  This is an optional specification and is not pulled from Battle.net.  Players can choose to withhold the information and also choose to lie if they wish.  It is recommended only as a social mechanism for setting up the most even matches in-game.<n/><n/>Race: Each player can specify his/her race by choosing the appropriate selection from the dropdown menu found near the bottom of the Avatars window.  This selection will affect what race you play as during the next match.<n/><n/>Wins: Refers to the total number of wins obtained by the given player during the current game.  Roll your mouse cursor over a player's name for global information.<n/><n/>Chips: Refers to the total number of Chips currently held by the given player.<n/><n/>You can reset your player stats by deleting the PeepModeHots.SC2Bank file from your hard drive - this will effectively make you "start from scratch" in the world of PeepMode.  Similarly, if you attempt to adjust values in the Bank (in order to cheat, for example), your file will be de-authorized and all of your stats will be reset to 0.  This cannot be undone.

These options will usually affect many (if not all) players in the game.  These options are as follows:<n/><n/>Match Mode - in most cases, this can be set to 2v2, 1v1, FFA, or a cominbation of those.  Some maps are limited to a subset of match modes (such as Xel'Naga Caverns, which supports only 1v1).  When multiple modes are selected (such as "1v1 or 2v2"), one of the modes will be chosen at random given the availability of eligible teams.  Two-thirds majority is required to change this option.<n/><n/>Similarly, Player Select Mode and Player Color Scheme both require two-thirds majority to change and do not take effect until the next match.<n/><n/>Disable Bling - this option removes Pets and Turf Markers from matches

If you have experience with SC2 modding and know a solution for any of these issues, please send an email to peepmode@gmail.com.<n/><n/>- When selecting a new player or team from the Observer pulldown menu, structures of enemy units are retained beneath fog of war regardless of whether the selected player(s) ever saw those structures.  This is difficult to fix since Blizzard doesn't expose this info to modders.  Work-arounds are being explored.<n/><n/>- The Info Panel wireframes (to the left of the unit portrait) remain stuck on upgraded versions of units after they've been upgraded for a given player.  Again, Blizzard does not expose the wireframe panel to modding.

Param/Value/B17349C9=After each match, the winning player/team will be marked by a golden crown.  These players will always be favored by the system when match selection occurs within an appropriate match mode.  For example, if a 2v2 is selected for the next match, any 2-player team marked with a crown will get first dibs on the next match.  However, in a situation such as "1v1 or 2v2”, crown possession *will not* limit the next match to only 2v2; if there are sufficient players on the field for a 1v1, that match mode will also be considered a valid candidate by the system. In most situations (including strict 1v1, 2v2, and FFA matches), the possession of the crown follows standard “King of the Hill (KOTH)” logic and those with crowns will always get first dibs on the next match.  To remove a crown so that the player is included in the normal random selection process, the player can simply become an observer (by clicking the "CANCEL" button), and then joining the team of his/her choice.  Switching teams and even splitting teams up will not affect crown possession.  Indeed, winners of a 2v2 match could split up and both be favored in the case of a 1v1 match selection if they so desired.

Param/Value/B2D23706=In order to enable more advanced chat controls, most of the normal chat system had to be replaced.  Unfortunately, the system is not able to support whispers and other "slash" chat commands because Blizzard does not expose them to modders.  Therefore, you will not be able to use such commands within this map.  The normal Battle.net social interface remains available, however.  Please note that sending chat messages to [All] or to [Allies] by tabbing has no effect.  Instead, messages will go only to those on your own team and to observing players.  During 1v1 games, your enemy can read your messages.  See the Options section for information on more advanced chat options.<n/><n/>While playing a 2v2 or FFA match, if you want to send a message to all players (including your enemies), prefix your message with ".all " as in ".all Hello enemy".  All players will see the message "Hello enemy".

Roll your mouse cursor over the race icons for detailed player info.<n/><n/>A more advanced version of the panel can be brought up by going to Personal Options and checking "Advanced resource panel".  Alt + M will also toggle this feature.<n/><n/>The Advanced Resource Panel shows current player stats in a tabular format.  Roll your mouse cursor over each icon next to a row of stats to see what that stat refers to.  Colorings are applied to individual stats of players who have the best score in each category.  This provides a mechanism for highlighting the best player(s) quickly.  Mineral and Vespene rows become yellow when > 1000 to denote unnecessary floating.  Supply stats become yellow when supply used is approaching supply made and become red when the player is experiencing supply block.

This could be due to a match taking too long, devious player strategies ("cheese"), or any other reason.  If a majority of all players choose to end a match, they can click this checkbox and the match will immediately end in a draw.  In this case, no Chips are awarded to any players and all placed bets are off.  Note that since the Voting Options menu is available only to observers, it would be impossible to garner enough votes to end a match which contained more players than observers.
