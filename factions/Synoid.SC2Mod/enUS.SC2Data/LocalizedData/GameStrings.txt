Param/Value/lib_03673618_1EEB4501=Hello! Thanks for playing my mod!<n/><n/>This is the first mod i've released, most of my modding experience came from playing around in the galaxy editor for fun.

Param/Value/lib_03673618_ABCE777C=In case you know nothing about this mod, here's the basics, i'll leave the rest for you to figure out yourself though.<n/><n/><c val="FFFF80">Basic Gameplay</c>:<n/><n/>- The Myco-Synaptic Choir, or MycoChoir for short, is your town hall, from it you can build every building the race has to offer at any time, anywhere on the map within a <c val="FF8000">Requisition Field</c>, much like in command and conquer, however, unlike in C&C the buildings with be built without interrupting the MycoChoir's function, so with a single one you can build any amount of structures simultaneously.  [Subject to change if necessary].<n/><n/>- The buildings on the second row are your productions structures, the <c val="FFFF80">Garrison</c>, the <c val="FFFF80">Assembly </c>and the <c val="FFFF80">Hangar</c>. Assigned to infantry, Mech and Air respectively, below them you have their specific tech structures you need to build next to progress further down the tech tree.<n/><n/>- The <c val="FF8000">Requisition Field</c> is the orange circle that surrounds the Myco-Processors and the (green circles around) Myco-Choirs and Greater Processors; its analogous to the protoss pylon energy field, however, it doesn't work in exactly the same manner. Some units and structures require the abilities to be cast within a requisition field, and all buildings, including some units, require a requisition field source nearby in order to function.<n/><n/>- All production buildings can be upgraded to a "super" variant that unlocks more advanced units and produces 25% faster, however, they require a <c val="80FF00">super requisition source (the green ones) </c>around them in order to function, in other words, a Myco-Choir and a Greater Processor nearby. You can upgrade Myco-Processors within super requisition sources into Greater Processors to expand the area. <n/><n/>- Prospectors [Name subject to change] are your main worker unit, they are used to build MycoChoirs, but can also transform into a number of defensive buildings that the MycoChoir is unable to deploy (for balance's sake).<n/><n/>- Servitors are your basic unit, they start off unable to attack air and only have slightly less health and DPS than a marine, however, they are smaller, cheaper, and can pack more of them in a smaller area, increasing their volume of fire. You can upgrade their health and equip them with missile launchers in the Bio-Synth Facility<n/><n/>- Cremators are an army defense unit, they have decent range and DPS and do damage in a line. While not nearly as mobile as hellions they can be upgraded to have a shield capable of intercepting missiles<n/><n/>- The Censer is your basic means of Bio healing, once their signature ability is enabled, they will become stationary and heal units in a decent radius, instead of bleeding energy, each heal will deplete energy, so be not afraid of using them.<n/><n/>- The warden airship is your basic means of transport, it can hold 2 extra units than the every other transport and it is capable of shielding and locking down enemy units at the cost of draining its own energy. - Hailstorm Turrets are your basic means of base defense, they can air and ground units, however they have separate weapons that work differently. The hellstorm missile pods are its basic readily available ground attack, which fires slow moving AOE projectiles that can be dodged by a unit that moves fast enough [Subject to change], <c val="FFFF80">The hailstorm dont start out with the anti-air weapon enabled, you have to enable it by researching it in the Satelite Uplink</c> [Subject to change]<n/><n/>- The Sat-Com Tower is a caster building useful for base defense, can reveal enemy units, repair mechanical units and summon small drones to help defend the base in case of emergencies. <n/><n/>- The Karolean Walker is your giant mech unit, slow but powerful long range attacks. Buffs friendly units by giving them +1 armor and +2 range directly under them, use them along the rest of your army for stronger pushes. Reveals iself while attacking.

Assigned to infantry, Mech and Air respectively, below them you have their specific tech structures you need to build next to progress further down the tech tree.<n/><n/>- The <c val="FF8000">Requisition Field</c> is the orange circle that surrounds the Myco-Processors and the (green circles around) Myco-Choirs and Greater Processors; its analogous to the protoss pylon energy field, however, it doesnt work in exactly the same manner. Some units and structures require the abilities to be cast within a requisition field, and all buildings, including some units, require a requisition field source nearby in order to function.<n/><n/>- All production buildings can be upgraded to a "super" variant that unlocks more advanced units and produces 25% faster, however, they require a <c val="80FF00">super requisition source (the green ones) </c>around them in order to function, in other words, a Myco-Choir and a Greater Processor nearby. You can upgrade Myco-Processors within super requisition sources into Greater Processors to expand the area. <n/><n/>- Prospectors [Name subject to change] are your main worker unit, they are used to build MycoChoirs, but can also transform into a number of defensive buildings that the MycoChoir is unable to deploy (for balance's sake).<n/><n/>- Servitors are your basic unit, they start off unable to attack air and only have slightly less health and DPS than a marine, however, they are smaller, cheaper, and can pack more of them in a smaller area, increasing their volume of fire. You can upgarde their health and equip them with missile launchers in the Bio-Synth Facility<n/><n/>- Cremators are the only unit exclusive to the Super Garrison, they have decent range and DPS and do damage in a line. While not nearly as mobile as hellions they can be upgraded to have a shield capable of intercepting missiles<n/><n/>- The Censer is your basic means of Bio healing, once their signature ability is enabled, they will become stationary and heal units in a decent radius, instead of bleeding energy, each heal will deplete energy, so be not afraid of using them.<n/><n/><n/>- The warden airship is your basic means of transport, it can hold 2 extra units than the every other transport and it is capable of shielding and locking down enemy units at the cost of draining its own energy. - Hailstorm Turrets are your basic means of base defense, they can air and ground units, however they have separate weapons that work differently. The hellstorm missile pods are its basic readily available ground attack, which fires slow moving AOE projectiles that can be dodged by a unit that moves fast enough [Subject to change], <c val="FFFF80">The hailstorm dont start out with the anti-air weapon enabled, you have to enable it by researching it in the Satelite Uplink</c> [Subject to change]<n/><n/>- The Sat-Com Tower is a caster building useful for base defense, can reveal enemy units, repair mechanical units and summon small drones to help defend the base in case of emergencies. <n/><n/>- The Karolean Walker is your giant mech unit, slow but powerful long range attacks. Buffs friendly units by giving them +1 armor and +2 range directly under them, use them along the rest of your army for stronger pushes.
