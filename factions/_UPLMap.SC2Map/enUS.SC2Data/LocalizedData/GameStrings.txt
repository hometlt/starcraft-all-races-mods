DocInfo/DescLong=Acropolis is a relatively small map for macro plays. Vertical third base expansions are easier to acquire and protect on this map. The area in the middle encourages direct conflict in the early game. Destroying rocks leads to more open passages.<n/><n/>Submitted to Teamliquid Map Contest<n/>Created by: RQM
