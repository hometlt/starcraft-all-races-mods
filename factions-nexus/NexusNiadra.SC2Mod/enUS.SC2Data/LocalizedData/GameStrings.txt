UserData/PlayerCommanders/[Override]ZergNya_Description=Broodmother which devours Protoss
UserData/PlayerCommanders/[Override]ZergNya_Story="The life bestowed upon us by the Queen is meant to destroy all Protoss."<n/><n/>The life forms of the Zerg are unpredictable and terrifying. Niadra is the most unique among the many Zerg, even from its larval stage.<n/>Following the commands implanted by Kerrigan since its birth, Niadra parasitizes, slaughters, and occupies an entire Protoss shuttle. It then settles in this dark ruin devoid of energy, drifting through the universe for countless light-years. Over the course of time, its Zerg forces have absorbed the psionic energy derived from the Protoss, evolving wildly in an unknown direction. Its thoughts have become clearer, even learning to use its tendrils to control the remnants of the Protoss. Terrifying life continues to hatch and grow on this derelict ship, waiting for another summons.
