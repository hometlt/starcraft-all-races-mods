Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00004=You move on, we'll keep this patch secured.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00005=Holy ground, huh? We'll keep her safe.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00006=Gonna need an army for that. We'll get out there when we can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00007=Still training troops. I'll get my men out there ASAP.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00008=Command center going up over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00009=We're taking a licking! Heading back!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00010=Where are you? We're dying out here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00011=We need backup, pronto!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00012=Now would be a great time for reinforcements.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00013=There's something moving out here! We need detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00014=Think I'll get back to running this show.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00015=Alright, I'm taking back control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00016=Can't hurt to take a look.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00017=We've scoped out this area. Scout's heading back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00018=Once I've trained up some soldiers we'll head out.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00019=Can't reach that location, partner.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00020=Little busy here. I'll send something out in a minute.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00021=Dammit, they killed my SCV. I'm sending out another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00022=Detection on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00023=Taking this raven back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00024=Building a raven now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00025=The raven's down. I'll send another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00026=We're going to take that expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00027=Putting up a command center.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00028=Can't reach that.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00029=Looks like we're facing some protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00030=Well, looks like our enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00031=We've got zerg over here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00032=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00033=Well, there's some familiar terran designs.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00034=Looks like a zerg building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00035=Looks like we've found a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00036=Bad guys, straight ahead.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00037=What the hell is this building doing all the way out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00038=We march forth.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00039=Understood. Our warriors move.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00040=We require more warriors. We shall attack once ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00041=None shall pass.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00042=We will defend once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00043=We move for victory!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00044=We must retreat!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00045=The attack will commence once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00046=I am in command.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00047=The enemy has cloaked! We require detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00048=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00049=Our scouts are headed to this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00050=Our scouting party returns.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00051=Our scouts will head to this location as soon as they can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00052=Our scout is unable to reach this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00053=Our scout has been destroyed! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00054=An observer is on its way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00055=Our detector must return to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00056=We are warping in a detector, immediately.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00057=Our detector has been slain! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00058=This location is ideal for our expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00059=Expansion secured. We are warping in a Nexus now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00060=Our forces cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00061=Our enemy is Protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00062=We have encountered enemy terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00063=Hostile zerg have shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00064=We have encountered an enemy Protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00065=This building belongs to the terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00066=This building bears the tainted flesh of the zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00067=The enemy's base has been discovered.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00068=We have encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00069=Leave nothing behind!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00070=I'm not ready. We'll attack once I've morphed enough zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00071=We'll have a surprise in store for them.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00072=My army isn't large enough. I'll defend as soon as I'm able.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00073=We are probing the enemy for weakness.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00074=The Swarm is returning to base. We're taking too many losses.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00075=Now we do things my way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00076=The enemy can cloak!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00077=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00078=So the protoss wish to do battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00079=The enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00080=An enemy brood wishes to challenge us?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00081=I agree. We will begin the attack once my army is ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00082=We've encountered a protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00083=There's an enemy zerg hive cluster around here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00084=We've discovered the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00085=We've encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00086=Why would they build this structure out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00087=Our scout is on the move.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00088=We've scouted the area. I'm taking my scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00089=My scout cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00090=Give me a moment. I'll scout as soon as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00091=They killed my scout! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00092=I require detection for other purposes.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00093=It's time to find out what's really going on.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00094=I'm morphing as quickly as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00095=They've killed the detector! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00096=We're taking this expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00097=Hive cluster implanted.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00098=Our drones cannot reach this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00099=A terran building...
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00100=Plant it, raiders.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00101=My boys are training right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00102=You can count on us.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00103=Heading out, and playing it cool.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00104=Encountering some tough resistance.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00105=My guys are headed back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00106=We're heading back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00107=I'm ordering an attack here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00108=Let's ruffle their feathers a bit!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00109=It's a little too crazy out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00110=Alright Raiders, back under my command.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00111=Time to get back to business.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00112=Done scouting.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00113=All done here. I'll take that scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00114=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00115=Scout's on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00116=My scout can't get there.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00117=You got a teleporter? Otherwise, we ain't getting there.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00118=Not happenin'.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00119=Looks like my scout's wrapping things up.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00120=Yeah, that's not happenin' right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00121=Great... Scout's dead.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00122=They got my scout!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00123=Get that command center built.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00124=Not gonna be able to pull that one off.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00125=Alright, I'm taking an expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00126=Build a raven, boys. Pronto.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00127=They busted my raven!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00128=Raven heading out.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00129=I'm gonna have to say no for now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00130=Their base is over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00131=Kinda far out for a building, don't ya think?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00132=And that would be the base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00133=Well, what do we have here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00134=Ran into an enemy base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00135=Looks like the bad guys have set up shop here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00136=That's one way to find the enemy.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00137=Looks like the enemy's shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00138=That's a zerg structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00139=Terran building sighted, and it ain't one of mine.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00140=We've found a protoss structure over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00141=Well, there's definitely enemy protoss out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00142=There's some hostile terrans out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00143=Aw man, zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00144=The protoss are looking for a fight.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00145=Terrans... Kill them.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00146=These zerg need to be reminded who their queen is.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00147=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00148=This building is terran in origin.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00149=This structure belongs to an enemy brood.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00150=The enemy's base is here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00151=Our enemy is headquartered here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00152=There. Our foe's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00153=Here. We've found the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00154=Strange. This structure doesn't belong here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00155=This base belongs to our foes.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00156=The enemy's forces have presented themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00157=The enemy. Good, I was getting bored.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00158=The Swarm is assaulting here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00159=The Swarm spares no one!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00160=My forces are not ready yet.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00161=Let them come.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00162=The enemy will regret coming here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00163=Curious, this building is far from a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00164=My forces need time to prepare.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00165=My brood is engaging here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00166=Slay them all! No quarter!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00167=We must return to the hive cluster.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00168=We're pulling back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00169=I am morphing more zerg. We will attack when ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00170=Extending control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00171=The Swarm is mine once again.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00172=We need detection.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00173=We are being overwhelmed!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00174=Where are the reinforcements?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00175=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00176=We concur. Our forces are en route.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00178=Our warriors are being readied.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00179=Here, we make our stand.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00180=We require additional warriors.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00181=Our forces will assault this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00182=We cannot survive this battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00183=Our warriors must pull back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00184=This fight is lost. We retreat.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00185=We will require additional troops.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00186=I am resuming control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00187=We have lost the enemy. Detection is required.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00188=We require reinforcement.

Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00004=New Record!
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00005=Welcome, Commander.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00006=Your objective in this exercise is to inflict maximum damage on the enemy with the limited forces at your disposal.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00007=The special abilities of your units will be key to achieving a high score. Use them wisely.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00008=Enemy forces are invulnerable until you indicate you are ready to begin by pressing the ready button.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00009=You must destroy as many enemies as possible with the creatures available. 
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00010=Scout the opposing base and when you are ready to begin your assault press the ready button.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00011=Time is short! Attack without mercy and inflict maximum damage!
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00012=En Taro Tassadar, student. A protoss warrior must learn to fight enemies as numerous as the stars in the sky.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00013=In this simulation, you will command a small force resisting waves of attackers. Slay as many as you can.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00014=Use terrain on the battlefield to your advantage. Fight only where your superior warcraft will even the odds.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00015=En Taro Tassadar, student. A protoss warrior understands the strengths of their own forces, and the weaknesses of the enemy.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00016=In this simulation, you will use a limited force to defend three pylons from attack.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00017=The pylons are some distance apart, you will need to divide your forces to protect all three.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00018=Study the opposing force and deploy your units so that they will most effectively counter the enemy.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00019=Once you have deployed your forces, press the ready button to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00020=Take heed, attempting to leave the deployment area will invoke punishment.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00021=These three spires are under threat. You must defend them with the forces available.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00022=The spires are widely separated. You must divide your forces to protect them all.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00023=Study your foes carefully. Deploy your minions to best counter each group of enemies.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00024=When you are fully prepared, press the ready button to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00025=Be warned! Attempts to leave the deployment zone will not be tolerated!
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00026=Greetings, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to use limited forces to defend three supply depots.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00027=The supply depots are widely spaced. You will need to split up your forces to create a guard detail for each one.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00028=You should attempt to form groups that will effectively counter the enemy units deployed against them.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00029=When you have completed your deployment, press the ready button to proceed.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00030=Warning!  You are leaving the deployment zone.  Arena turrets activated.  
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00031=Good afternoon, Commander. In this exercise, you must defend all of your structures against a variety of enemy attacks.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00032=You will not have the ability to train additional combat units.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00033=In order to succeed, you will need to use your SCVs to repair your structures and to fight back against the aggressors.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00034=En Taro Tassadar, student. In this simulation, you will learn to control large forces more efficiently.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00035=Begin by organizing your forces into control groups. Examine the units available to you and distribute them into powerful attack groups.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00036=As you can see, you have units stationed throughout the simulation area. These are in stasis until you are ready to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00037=Round 1
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00038=Welcome back, Commander. A strong economy is key to victory, and the key to a strong economy is efficient resource gathering.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00039=In this exercise your base management skills will be challenged. Begin by collecting sufficient resources to expand to the extra resource area nearby. 
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00040=By building a second command center at the expansion site, you will effectively double the amount of resources you receive.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00041=Complete the exercise by training a force before the time runs out.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00042=Good morning, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to survive through several waves of attackers.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00043=Each wave will be challenging to overcome with the forces available. Directly controlling the actions of your units will give you the edge you need to prevail.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00044=Press the ready button when you wish to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00045=Welcome, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to inflict maximum possible damage using only the siege tanks and medivac dropships allocated.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00046=You will have a limited amount of time to destroy as much of the enemy base as possible. Scouting the base with your medivacs before making your assault is advised.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00047=Enemy forces cannot be harmed until you press the ready button, so conduct your scouting carefully.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00048=Once you are ready, strike swiftly! Destroy as many enemies as possible before time runs out!

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Group00001=Story So Far Cutscene
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00001=For nearly 300 years, humans thought they were alone in Koprulu sector.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00002=The zerg emerged, seeking to consume all in their path.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00003=And before long, the protoss, a highly advanced alien race, began wiping out infested worlds, burning zerg and terran alike. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00004=A three-way war... unlike anything humanity had ever faced...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00005=All the while... a human civil war raged.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00006=Marshal Jim Raynor vowed to oppose the corrupt dictator Arcturus Mengsk for the betrayal of the woman he loved... Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00007=Uh, boys? How about that evac?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00008=Damn you, Arcturus! Don't do this.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00009=It's done. Helmsman, signal the fleet and take us out of orbit. Now!
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00010=Kerrigan, a loyal operative, was left to die at the hands of the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00011=But the zerg had other plans.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00012=They transformed her... and unleashed her psionic power upon the Koprulu Sector...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00013=...searching for their real objective...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00014=The protoss were unaware of this danger... and slow to respond.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00015=Their rulers, the Conclave, had dispatched Executor Artanis to hunt for Tassadar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00016=...a commander who had refused to wipe out infested terran worlds.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00017=They crossed paths with a dark templar mystic, whose kind was considered heretics by the Conclave.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00018=Through great effort, Zeratul convinced Tassadar and Artanis that he was not their enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00019=Together they rallied more protoss from both factions against the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00020=Despite the Conclave's fury, they achieved significant victories against the Swarm.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00021=But when Zeratul struck down one of the Overmind's Cerebrates...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00022=From his thoughts, the Overmind gleaned Aiur's true location...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00023=...and the Swarm descended upon the protoss homeworld...

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00025=Using the power of both the templar and the dark templar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00026=Aiur was lost
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00027=Old prejudices were set aside.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00028=Without the Overmind, the swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00029=Kerrigan sought control of all the zerg...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00030=Once her rule was uncontested...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00031=The zerg stood unchallenged, but to the relief of all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00032=Zeratul suspected the zerg had fallen under the control of dark forces.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00033=He uncovered prophecies stating that an ancient entity, Amon...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00034=And that this evil might already have control...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00035=It was during this time that Executor Artanis, hailed as a hero...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00036=As Hierarch, Artanis united both factions...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00037=But such unity is only a dream for Jim Raynor.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00038=Mengsk still rules, and Raynor's small rebellion has counted for nothing against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00039=Perhaps... it is time for a new strategy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00040=Raynor had vowed to see Kerrigan dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00041=Even his rebellion against Mengsk's tyranny...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00042=But with the arrival of old friends, and mysterious new allies...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00043=...scoring major victories on multiple fronts.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00044=But Zeratul warned him about the encroaching darkness...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00045=...was the Queen of Blades. She was needed alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00046=In a daring raid on the zerg homeworld of Char...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00047=...used an ancient xel'naga artifact to neutralize Kerrigan's power...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00048=The Queen of Blades was helpless.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00049=Jim?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00050=It's okay. I gotcha.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00051=Without a leader, the Swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00052=Raynor and Kerrigan found sanctuary with Valerian Mengsk...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00053=Valerian Mengsk offered them sanctuary... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00054=During the raid, Kerrigan and Raynor were separated. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00055=...He was briefly interrogated, and summarily executed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00056=Kerrigan sought vengeance.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00057=With Zeratul's guidance, Kerrigan gathered the zerg broods...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00058=The killing will never stop until Mengsk is dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00059=Kerrigan began dismantling the Dominion's military...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00060=To her surprise... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00061=She charted a course to Korhal, Mengsk's stronghold. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00062=But there was little time to celebrate.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00063=Raynor and Valerian Mengsk set about reforming the Dominion... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00064=With the zerg and terrans quelled...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00065=He declared that the unified protoss...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00066=Any dissenting voices went unheard amid the hope for reclamation.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00067=Zeratul set off alone, searching for the truth...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00068=They were wrong.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00069=...erupted almost overnight.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00070=The protoss homeworld of Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00071=...with all their might and fury.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00072=...but Artanis led the survivors to the dark templar's homeworld of Shakuras.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00073=The templar were now in the dark templar's debt.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00074=...even enlisting the aid of old friends and enemies like Raynor, Mengsk, and Zeratul.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00075=The Queen of Blades betrayed them all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00076=Billions of humans and protoss were killed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00077=He sacrificed himself to kill the Overmind.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00078=...his own mind was left vulnerable.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00079=The war seemed to end there.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00080=...was attempting to merge protoss and zerg life forms into an unholy hybrid.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00081=...of Kerrigan and her power.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00082=...was made leader of both the templar and the dark templar.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00083=...and promised to one day reclaim the glory they had lost on Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00084=But his retaliatory strike failed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00085=...proved ineffective against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00086=Raynor revived his campaign against the Dominion...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00087=...and said the key to stopping Amon... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00088=...armies from the Dominion and Raynor...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00089=...with help from Arcturus' son, Valerian...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00090=...and free her from Amon's grasp.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00091=The Dominion wanted her dead. Raynor couldn't allow it.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00092=...and began planning their next move.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00093=...but his father could not let this opportunity pass.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00094=Kerrigan escaped, while Raynor...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00095=She set out to reclaim her position... as Queen of Blades.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00096=...and ruled the Swarm once again... only this time... free.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00097=...one mission at a time.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00098=She learned that Raynor was still alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00099=Despite encountering his best troops,  and traps, she personally ended his life.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00100=Amon's plans were still unfolding.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00101=Kerrigan left Raynor to rebuild while she hunted her true enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00102=...with a just government.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00103=Hierarch Artanis saw an opportunity. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00104=...templar and dark templar alike... would retake Aiur.

Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00044=The Protoss are an ancient alien race that employ advanced technologies and powerful psionics to defeat their enemies.
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00045=Protoss have shields on their units and structures to protect them from enemy attacks. Shield strength is represented by a blue bar above the hit-point bar.
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00046=Shields are reduced by enemy attacks in the same manner as hit-points, however shields regenerate quickly after combat has finished. 
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00047=Xel'Naga Watch Towers can be controlled by any player. Place a unit near the Watch Tower to activate it and reveal a large area of the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00048=If several players have units near a Watch Tower then the tower is not controlled and no player can activate it.
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00049=Some obstacles can be destroyed by weapons fire, and you can attack obstacles to clear a path for your troops.

Character/Description/ARC@Jumper=Ex-asteroid miners conscripted into service in the terran infantry. They are still very unrefined and crude. Similar in tone to the sleaziest construction worker you've ever heard of.

Conversation/InfantryJumper/ARC@Line00029=Alright, Space mining 101. They call this badboy an ARC gun. You point it an asteroid, squeeze the trigger, and BLAM, nothing but meteors.
