Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00004=You move on, we'll keep this patch secured.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00005=Holy ground, huh? We'll keep her safe.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00006=Gonna need an army for that. We'll get out there when we can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00007=Still training troops. I'll get my men out there ASAP.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00008=Command center going up over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00009=We're taking a licking! Heading back!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00010=Where are you? We're dying out here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00011=We need backup, pronto!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00012=Now would be a great time for reinforcements.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00013=There's something moving out here! We need detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00014=Think I'll get back to running this show.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00015=Alright, I'm taking back control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00016=Can't hurt to take a look.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00017=We've scoped out this area. Scout's heading back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00018=Once I've trained up some soldiers we'll head out.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00019=Can't reach that location, partner.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00020=Little busy here. I'll send something out in a minute.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00021=Dammit, they killed my SCV. I'm sending out another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00022=Detection on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00023=Taking this raven back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00024=Building a raven now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00025=The raven's down. I'll send another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00026=We're going to take that expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00027=Putting up a command center.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00028=Can't reach that.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00029=Looks like we're facing some protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00030=Well, looks like our enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00031=We've got zerg over here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00032=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00033=Well, there's some familiar terran designs.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00034=Looks like a zerg building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00035=Looks like we've found a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00036=Bad guys, straight ahead.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00037=What the hell is this building doing all the way out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00038=We march forth.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00039=Understood. Our warriors move.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00040=We require more warriors. We shall attack once ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00041=None shall pass.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00042=We will defend once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00043=We move for victory!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00044=We must retreat!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00045=The attack will commence once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00046=I am in command.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00047=The enemy has cloaked! We require detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00048=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00049=Our scouts are headed to this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00050=Our scouting party returns.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00051=Our scouts will head to this location as soon as they can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00052=Our scout is unable to reach this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00053=Our scout has been destroyed! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00054=An observer is on its way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00055=Our detector must return to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00056=We are warping in a detector, immediately.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00057=Our detector has been slain! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00058=This location is ideal for our expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00059=Expansion secured. We are warping in a Nexus now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00060=Our forces cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00061=Our enemy is Protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00062=We have encountered enemy terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00063=Hostile zerg have shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00064=We have encountered an enemy Protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00065=This building belongs to the terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00066=This building bears the tainted flesh of the zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00067=The enemy's base has been discovered.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00068=We have encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00069=Leave nothing behind!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00070=I'm not ready. We'll attack once I've morphed enough zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00071=We'll have a surprise in store for them.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00072=My army isn't large enough. I'll defend as soon as I'm able.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00073=We are probing the enemy for weakness.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00074=The Swarm is returning to base. We're taking too many losses.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00075=Now we do things my way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00076=The enemy can cloak!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00077=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00078=So the protoss wish to do battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00079=The enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00080=An enemy brood wishes to challenge us?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00081=I agree. We will begin the attack once my army is ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00082=We've encountered a protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00083=There's an enemy zerg hive cluster around here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00084=We've discovered the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00085=We've encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00086=Why would they build this structure out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00087=Our scout is on the move.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00088=We've scouted the area. I'm taking my scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00089=My scout cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00090=Give me a moment. I'll scout as soon as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00091=They killed my scout! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00092=I require detection for other purposes.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00093=It's time to find out what's really going on.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00094=I'm morphing as quickly as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00095=They've killed the detector! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00096=We're taking this expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00097=Hive cluster implanted.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00098=Our drones cannot reach this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00099=A terran building...
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00100=Plant it, raiders.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00101=My boys are training right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00102=You can count on us.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00103=Heading out, and playing it cool.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00104=Encountering some tough resistance.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00105=My guys are headed back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00106=We're heading back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00107=I'm ordering an attack here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00108=Let's ruffle their feathers a bit!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00109=It's a little too crazy out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00110=Alright Raiders, back under my command.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00111=Time to get back to business.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00112=Done scouting.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00113=All done here. I'll take that scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00114=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00115=Scout's on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00116=My scout can't get there.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00117=You got a teleporter? Otherwise, we ain't getting there.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00118=Not happenin'.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00119=Looks like my scout's wrapping things up.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00120=Yeah, that's not happenin' right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00121=Great... Scout's dead.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00122=They got my scout!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00123=Get that command center built.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00124=Not gonna be able to pull that one off.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00125=Alright, I'm taking an expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00126=Build a raven, boys. Pronto.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00127=They busted my raven!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00128=Raven heading out.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00129=I'm gonna have to say no for now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00130=Their base is over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00131=Kinda far out for a building, don't ya think?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00132=And that would be the base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00133=Well, what do we have here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00134=Ran into an enemy base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00135=Looks like the bad guys have set up shop here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00136=That's one way to find the enemy.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00137=Looks like the enemy's shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00138=That's a zerg structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00139=Terran building sighted, and it ain't one of mine.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00140=We've found a protoss structure over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00141=Well, there's definitely enemy protoss out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00142=There's some hostile terrans out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00143=Aw man, zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00144=The protoss are looking for a fight.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00145=Terrans... Kill them.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00146=These zerg need to be reminded who their queen is.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00147=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00148=This building is terran in origin.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00149=This structure belongs to an enemy brood.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00150=The enemy's base is here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00151=Our enemy is headquartered here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00152=There. Our foe's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00153=Here. We've found the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00154=Strange. This structure doesn't belong here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00155=This base belongs to our foes.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00156=The enemy's forces have presented themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00157=The enemy. Good, I was getting bored.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00158=The Swarm is assaulting here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00159=The Swarm spares no one!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00160=My forces are not ready yet.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00161=Let them come.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00162=The enemy will regret coming here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00163=Curious, this building is far from a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00164=My forces need time to prepare.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00165=My brood is engaging here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00166=Slay them all! No quarter!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00167=We must return to the hive cluster.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00168=We're pulling back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00169=I am morphing more zerg. We will attack when ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00170=Extending control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00171=The Swarm is mine once again.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00172=We need detection.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00173=We are being overwhelmed!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00174=Where are the reinforcements?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00175=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00176=We concur. Our forces are en route.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00178=Our warriors are being readied.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00179=Here, we make our stand.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00180=We require additional warriors.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00181=Our forces will assault this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00182=We cannot survive this battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00183=Our warriors must pull back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00184=This fight is lost. We retreat.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00185=We will require additional troops.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00186=I am resuming control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00187=We have lost the enemy. Detection is required.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00188=We require reinforcement.

Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00004=New Record!
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00005=Welcome, Commander.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00006=Your objective in this exercise is to inflict maximum damage on the enemy with the limited forces at your disposal.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00007=The special abilities of your units will be key to achieving a high score. Use them wisely.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00008=Enemy forces are invulnerable until you indicate you are ready to begin by pressing the ready button.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00009=You must destroy as many enemies as possible with the creatures available. 
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00010=Scout the opposing base and when you are ready to begin your assault press the ready button.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00011=Time is short! Attack without mercy and inflict maximum damage!
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00012=En Taro Tassadar, student. A protoss warrior must learn to fight enemies as numerous as the stars in the sky.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00013=In this simulation, you will command a small force resisting waves of attackers. Slay as many as you can.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00014=Use terrain on the battlefield to your advantage. Fight only where your superior warcraft will even the odds.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00015=En Taro Tassadar, student. A protoss warrior understands the strengths of their own forces, and the weaknesses of the enemy.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00016=In this simulation, you will use a limited force to defend three pylons from attack.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00017=The pylons are some distance apart, you will need to divide your forces to protect all three.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00018=Study the opposing force and deploy your units so that they will most effectively counter the enemy.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00019=Once you have deployed your forces, press the ready button to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00020=Take heed, attempting to leave the deployment area will invoke punishment.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00021=These three spires are under threat. You must defend them with the forces available.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00022=The spires are widely separated. You must divide your forces to protect them all.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00023=Study your foes carefully. Deploy your minions to best counter each group of enemies.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00024=When you are fully prepared, press the ready button to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00025=Be warned! Attempts to leave the deployment zone will not be tolerated!
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00026=Greetings, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to use limited forces to defend three supply depots.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00027=The supply depots are widely spaced. You will need to split up your forces to create a guard detail for each one.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00028=You should attempt to form groups that will effectively counter the enemy units deployed against them.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00029=When you have completed your deployment, press the ready button to proceed.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00030=Warning!  You are leaving the deployment zone.  Arena turrets activated.  
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00031=Good afternoon, Commander. In this exercise, you must defend all of your structures against a variety of enemy attacks.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00032=You will not have the ability to train additional combat units.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00033=In order to succeed, you will need to use your SCVs to repair your structures and to fight back against the aggressors.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00034=En Taro Tassadar, student. In this simulation, you will learn to control large forces more efficiently.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00035=Begin by organizing your forces into control groups. Examine the units available to you and distribute them into powerful attack groups.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00036=As you can see, you have units stationed throughout the simulation area. These are in stasis until you are ready to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00037=Round 1
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00038=Welcome back, Commander. A strong economy is key to victory, and the key to a strong economy is efficient resource gathering.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00039=In this exercise your base management skills will be challenged. Begin by collecting sufficient resources to expand to the extra resource area nearby. 
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00040=By building a second command center at the expansion site, you will effectively double the amount of resources you receive.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00041=Complete the exercise by training a force before the time runs out.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00042=Good morning, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to survive through several waves of attackers.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00043=Each wave will be challenging to overcome with the forces available. Directly controlling the actions of your units will give you the edge you need to prevail.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00044=Press the ready button when you wish to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00045=Welcome, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to inflict maximum possible damage using only the siege tanks and medivac dropships allocated.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00046=You will have a limited amount of time to destroy as much of the enemy base as possible. Scouting the base with your medivacs before making your assault is advised.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00047=Enemy forces cannot be harmed until you press the ready button, so conduct your scouting carefully.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARC@Line00048=Once you are ready, strike swiftly! Destroy as many enemies as possible before time runs out!

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Group00001=Story So Far Cutscene
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00001=For nearly 300 years, humans thought they were alone in Koprulu sector.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00002=The zerg emerged, seeking to consume all in their path.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00003=And before long, the protoss, a highly advanced alien race, began wiping out infested worlds, burning zerg and terran alike. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00004=A three-way war... unlike anything humanity had ever faced...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00005=All the while... a human civil war raged.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00006=Marshal Jim Raynor vowed to oppose the corrupt dictator Arcturus Mengsk for the betrayal of the woman he loved... Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00007=Uh, boys? How about that evac?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00008=Damn you, Arcturus! Don't do this.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00009=It's done. Helmsman, signal the fleet and take us out of orbit. Now!
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00010=Kerrigan, a loyal operative, was left to die at the hands of the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00011=But the zerg had other plans.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00012=They transformed her... and unleashed her psionic power upon the Koprulu Sector...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00013=...searching for their real objective...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00014=The protoss were unaware of this danger... and slow to respond.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00015=Their rulers, the Conclave, had dispatched Executor Artanis to hunt for Tassadar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00016=...a commander who had refused to wipe out infested terran worlds.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00017=They crossed paths with a dark templar mystic, whose kind was considered heretics by the Conclave.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00018=Through great effort, Zeratul convinced Tassadar and Artanis that he was not their enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00019=Together they rallied more protoss from both factions against the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00020=Despite the Conclave's fury, they achieved significant victories against the Swarm.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00021=But when Zeratul struck down one of the Overmind's Cerebrates...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00022=From his thoughts, the Overmind gleaned Aiur's true location...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00023=...and the Swarm descended upon the protoss homeworld...

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00025=Using the power of both the templar and the dark templar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00026=Aiur was lost
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00027=Old prejudices were set aside.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00028=Without the Overmind, the swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00029=Kerrigan sought control of all the zerg...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00030=Once her rule was uncontested...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00031=The zerg stood unchallenged, but to the relief of all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00032=Zeratul suspected the zerg had fallen under the control of dark forces.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00033=He uncovered prophecies stating that an ancient entity, Amon...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00034=And that this evil might already have control...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00035=It was during this time that Executor Artanis, hailed as a hero...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00036=As Hierarch, Artanis united both factions...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00037=But such unity is only a dream for Jim Raynor.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00038=Mengsk still rules, and Raynor's small rebellion has counted for nothing against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00039=Perhaps... it is time for a new strategy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00040=Raynor had vowed to see Kerrigan dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00041=Even his rebellion against Mengsk's tyranny...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00042=But with the arrival of old friends, and mysterious new allies...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00043=...scoring major victories on multiple fronts.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00044=But Zeratul warned him about the encroaching darkness...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00045=...was the Queen of Blades. She was needed alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00046=In a daring raid on the zerg homeworld of Char...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00047=...used an ancient xel'naga artifact to neutralize Kerrigan's power...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00048=The Queen of Blades was helpless.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00049=Jim?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00050=It's okay. I gotcha.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00051=Without a leader, the Swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00052=Raynor and Kerrigan found sanctuary with Valerian Mengsk...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00053=Valerian Mengsk offered them sanctuary... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00054=During the raid, Kerrigan and Raynor were separated. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00055=...He was briefly interrogated, and summarily executed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00056=Kerrigan sought vengeance.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00057=With Zeratul's guidance, Kerrigan gathered the zerg broods...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00058=The killing will never stop until Mengsk is dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00059=Kerrigan began dismantling the Dominion's military...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00060=To her surprise... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00061=She charted a course to Korhal, Mengsk's stronghold. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00062=But there was little time to celebrate.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00063=Raynor and Valerian Mengsk set about reforming the Dominion... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00064=With the zerg and terrans quelled...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00065=He declared that the unified protoss...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00066=Any dissenting voices went unheard amid the hope for reclamation.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00067=Zeratul set off alone, searching for the truth...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00068=They were wrong.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00069=...erupted almost overnight.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00070=The protoss homeworld of Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00071=...with all their might and fury.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00072=...but Artanis led the survivors to the dark templar's homeworld of Shakuras.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00073=The templar were now in the dark templar's debt.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00074=...even enlisting the aid of old friends and enemies like Raynor, Mengsk, and Zeratul.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00075=The Queen of Blades betrayed them all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00076=Billions of humans and protoss were killed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00077=He sacrificed himself to kill the Overmind.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00078=...his own mind was left vulnerable.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00079=The war seemed to end there.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00080=...was attempting to merge protoss and zerg life forms into an unholy hybrid.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00081=...of Kerrigan and her power.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00082=...was made leader of both the templar and the dark templar.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00083=...and promised to one day reclaim the glory they had lost on Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00084=But his retaliatory strike failed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00085=...proved ineffective against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00086=Raynor revived his campaign against the Dominion...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00087=...and said the key to stopping Amon... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00088=...armies from the Dominion and Raynor...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00089=...with help from Arcturus' son, Valerian...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00090=...and free her from Amon's grasp.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00091=The Dominion wanted her dead. Raynor couldn't allow it.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00092=...and began planning their next move.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00093=...but his father could not let this opportunity pass.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00094=Kerrigan escaped, while Raynor...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00095=She set out to reclaim her position... as Queen of Blades.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00096=...and ruled the Swarm once again... only this time... free.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00097=...one mission at a time.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00098=She learned that Raynor was still alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00099=Despite encountering his best troops,  and traps, she personally ended his life.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00100=Amon's plans were still unfolding.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00101=Kerrigan left Raynor to rebuild while she hunted her true enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00102=...with a just government.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00103=Hierarch Artanis saw an opportunity. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARC@Line00104=...templar and dark templar alike... would retake Aiur.

Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00044=The Protoss are an ancient alien race that employ advanced technologies and powerful psionics to defeat their enemies.
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00045=Protoss have shields on their units and structures to protect them from enemy attacks. Shield strength is represented by a blue bar above the hit-point bar.
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00046=Shields are reduced by enemy attacks in the same manner as hit-points, however shields regenerate quickly after combat has finished. 
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00047=Xel'Naga Watch Towers can be controlled by any player. Place a unit near the Watch Tower to activate it and reveal a large area of the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00048=If several players have units near a Watch Tower then the tower is not controlled and no player can activate it.
Conversation/Tutorial/ARC@Line00049=Some obstacles can be destroyed by weapons fire, and you can attack obstacles to clear a path for your troops.

Character/Description/ARC@Jumper=Ex-asteroid miners conscripted into service in the terran infantry. They are still very unrefined and crude. Similar in tone to the sleaziest construction worker you've ever heard of.

Conversation/InfantryJumper/ARC@Line00029=Alright, Space mining 101. They call this badboy an ARC gun. You point it an asteroid, squeeze the trigger, and BLAM, nothing but meteors.

VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Pissed08=By the way, freedom is NOT free, okay? Freedom costs a buck o' five! Everyone knows that!
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Ready00=Liberation is at hand.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Ready01=Reporting for action.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Ready_NP00=Assimilation complete.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What00=Need something liberated?

VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What03=We have you onscreen.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What04=Attention!
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What05=Yes, sir?
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What06=Standing by.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What07=We read you.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What08=How can we help?
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What09=Got freedom?
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@What_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Yes00=Of course.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Yes01=Perfect.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Yes02=Easy.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Yes03=Flight plan is locked.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Yes04=As you say.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Yes05=Initiating.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Yes06=Course set.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Yes07=Full speed.

Character/Description/ARC@ZealotAlarak=Supplicants are the lowest ranking Tal'darim. They live to serve and die for those above them on the Chain of Ascension, at least until they gain enough power and influence to challenge them to Rak'Shir. They are fanatically loyal not to any single Tal'darim (though they will say they are), but to the Chain of Ascension itself.

VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Attack06=Vengeance is mine.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Death00=My wrath is not quenched! 
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Help00=My blades have met the enemy.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Pissed00=My patience runs short, Templar. Do not press me further.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Pissed01=Are you incapable of listening? Or just comprehending?
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Pissed02=So this is the zerg... the "great enemy" who brought the Templar so low? How utterly disappointing.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Pissed03=Bow before your Highlord and submit completely to my rule. Really!?!
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Pissed04=Oh, Hierarch. Is this how you spend your free time? No wonder these "missions" of yours take so very very long...
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Pissed05=There are fates worse than death, you know. I could have you extract terrazine until you lose your mind like that fool Nyon.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Pissed06=(huffs terrazine) The breath of creation fuels my every... what was I... what was I saying? I'm hungry.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Pissed07=Hmm. Maybe I've got it all wrong. Maybe I should show a little compassion. Maybe Amon is just misunderstood... Maybe, maybe we both are.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Ready00=The hour of my vengeance has come!
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@What00=Speak. Now.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@What01=You address the Highlord.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@What02=How shall you serve me?
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@What03=What?
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@What04=Do not waste my time.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@What05=Of course I am needed.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@What06=State your request.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Yes00=Only because I will it.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Yes01=As I desire. 
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Yes02=So shall it be.
VoiceOver/Alarak/ARC@Yes03=Oh, well... I agree with this choice.

VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@Pissed00=In this desperate hour, all who are able to serve must do so--Even those who have fallen.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@Pissed01=Identify our foe, and it shall be annihilated.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@Pissed02=I must warn you, your taunts are ill-advised, Templar.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@Pissed03=I once fought for the liberation of Shakuras against the zerg Swarm itself. I do not have sit idly and accept this abuse.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@Pissed04=Do not force me to emerge from this walker and teach you a lesson.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@Pissed05=Enough! <struggles a bit> Someone tell me how to get out of this thing!
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@Pissed06=<frustrated exertion> You are quite fortunate these tubes are difficult to remove.

VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@What01=Yes?
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@What02=I'm waiting...
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@What03=Zerashk gulida! (Translation: Oblivion awaits!)
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@What04=I fight on.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@What05=The fallen still serve.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@What06=You call upon me?
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@Yes00=For Aiur.
VoiceOver/Annihilator/ARC@Yes01=Ner'mah. (Translation: Cosmic balance.)

VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Attack05=Let our enemies fall.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Attack06=We strike from the skies.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Help00=This vessel is under assault.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Pissed00=Ah, another soul in search of answers.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Pissed01=We judicators are eternally grateful that our Hierarch has allowed us to serve Aiur once more.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Pissed02=And yet, you Templar are still wary of our actions. Our desire to fight for our homeworld is equal to any other.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Pissed03=You desire a lesson in time travel? Very well.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Pissed04=To understand time you must first conceive it. Think of a flat circle. Now, imagine twenty five million circles intersecting that circle at different points from the center.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Pissed05=This is not a hard thing, Templar. Younglings are taught this exercise...
VoiceOver/Arbiter/ARC@Pissed06=(resigned)Perhaps we should begin again. <SFX: Rewinding of the past few lines replaying like a tape deck and then replaying "You desire a lesson in time travel? Very well.">

VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Attack05=We fight against the darkness!
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Attack06=This duty is mine.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Help00=Stand with me!
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Pissed00=I will bring unity to the Firstborn.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Pissed01=We shall forge a new peace.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Pissed02=I might be Hierarch, yes, but that does not mean I enjoy speaking at great length.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Pissed03=You are quite insistent, aren't you? Perhaps you are part Tal'darim...
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Pissed04=<threatening> When I was a Templar, I could solve problems with a psi-blade, if you take my meaning.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Pissed05=Adun, Tassadar, Zeratul... All of my mentors met an early end. Perhaps the cost of greatness is too high?
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Pissed06=Have you ever said my name backwards? There is a strange music to it...
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Ready00=We must stand as one.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@What00=Dawn will come.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@What01=We shall prevail.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@What02=Our destiny awaits.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@What03=Strength in unity.

VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Yes00=A bold plan.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Yes01=Our path is clear.

VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARC@Yes03=Together, we are strong.

VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Attack01=Your agony begins.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Attack02=By blood and fury.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Attack03=Unmitigated chaos.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Attack04=I shall ascend.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Attack05=Thus I conquer.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Attack06=Woe to the slain.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Death00=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Death01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Death02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Help00=You dare to challenge me?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Pissed00=We are bound by the chain of ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Pissed01=But through Rak'shir we find ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Pissed02=My thoughts are guided by the terrazine mists. Amon knows we are coming, he knows we shall claim our vengeance.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Pissed03=You are simply unaware of the gifts granted to us through the breath of creation... the unseen truths it brings to light...
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Pissed04=Shakuras has fallen... Aiur has fallen... Does that mean all of these structures were constructed aboard the Spear of Adun?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Pissed05=If an immortal dies, does that mean it was never an immortal to begin with?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Pissed06=What if our entire universe was just a game being played by beings of incredible power?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Pissed07=And then there were beings watching those beings play their games instead of actually playing the games themselves.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Pissed08=Ow. I'm twitching... Perhaps I should limit my terrazine intake... for a while.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Ready00=Vengeance for the betrayed.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@What00=Ask. I may listen.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@What01=Action is the only course.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@What02=May the terrazine flow...
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@What03=The talons of Slayn listen.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@What04=Remember your place.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@What05=Alakor nir shazak.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@What06=I heed, because Alarak wills it.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Yes00=Acceptable.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Yes01=As the chain commands.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Yes02=Ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Yes03=Na adan korikas.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Yes04=Until I choose otherwise.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Yes05=Ulas zavir.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARC@Yes06=I concur.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Attack00=Our revenge is at hand!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Attack01=Templari por Aiur!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Attack02=Justice will reign.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Attack03=Death to enemies of the Firstborn!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Attack04=We are steadfast.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Attack05=For the Hierarch!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Death00=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Death01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Death02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Death03=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Help00=May this battle bring us glory!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Pissed00=I serve the Firstborn.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Pissed01=Our fate lies with our homeland. 
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Pissed02=Many of our people have fallen... but their deaths will not be in vain.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Pissed03=The enemy has changed, and so must we.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Pissed04=I imagine that Adun never thought he'd see someone like me.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Pissed05=What do you call an Aiur protoss who can meld with the shadows? Hm... Overpowered!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Pissed06=I am but ONE avenger. Please do not refer to us in the plural form. 
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Ready00=Vengeance for Aiur.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@What00=We will atone.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@What01=There is no solace in exile.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@What02=Give your order.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@What03=Retribution awaits.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@What04=Our day will come.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@What05=Aiur shall rise anew.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@What06=Glory through perseverance.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Yes00=With pride!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Yes01=As you say.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Yes02=So shall it be.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Yes03=We obey.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Yes04=En aras addari.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Yes05=Our light lives on.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARC@Yes06=Eternally.
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARC@Help00=We have met the enemy.
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARC@Yes00=Zara kunul. (Translation: Course set.)
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARC@Yes01=The time is now.
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARC@Yes02=To victory.
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARC@Yes03=Na azum. (Translation: We concur.)
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARC@Yes04=Agreed.
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARC@Yes05=Prepared to engage.
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARC@Yes06=Justice is served.
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARC@Yes07=The battle is won.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Attack00=Hold nothing back!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Attack01=I have but one life to give!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Attack02=Let me die honorable.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Attack03=By the grace of Aiur!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Attack04=Zhakul guilda!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Attack05=They shall be disrupted...
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Attack06=I fight to the end.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Help00=The battle begins!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Pissed00=These skies are mine.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Pissed01=Look at all the pretty lights!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Pissed02=I wonder what this button does.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Pissed03=I think this was a big mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Pissed04=You might even say... a huge mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Pissed05=If only I hadn't fallen asleep during my break lessons.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Pissed06=I must stop staring at the sun.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Pissed07=Corners like it's on rails.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Pissed08=I feel the need... the need for... an ejector seat! Look out!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Ready00=It is a good day to die.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@What00=Ready for battle.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@What01=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@What02=Let us attack!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@What03=May I be of service?
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@What04=Honor through valor.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@What05=The skies beckon.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Yes00=Adun Toridas!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Yes01=Ah, at last!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Yes02=I thought you'd see it my way.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Yes03=Eyes to the horizon.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Yes04=Joh'gaav!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Yes05=The sky is my battlefield.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARC@Yes06=I shall be swift.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Attack00=Wrath...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Attack01=Your energy is ours...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Attack02=Consume.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Attack03=Darkness overpowering!
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Attack04=Feeble minds...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Attack05=Unending torment.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Attack06=Smolder...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Help00=Conflict arises.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Pissed00=Aldaris... Betrayer, betrayed.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Pissed01=We live... In times of great need...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Pissed02=Once you go Dark Archon... you never come back...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Pissed03=Do not tempt us... Your mind is not as strong as you think.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Pissed04=Ulreazj lives on... We feel his rage.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Pissed05=The Void... filled with hatred... it mirrors our own.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Pissed06=Our existence... is suffering... do not prolong it.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Ready00=We are as one...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@What00=Must have energy...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@What01=We hear you...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@What02=Thoughts in chaos...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@What03=Must feed...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@What04=Energy...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@What05=Your will... is ours...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@What06=We roil.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Yes00=Will go...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Yes01=Oblivion awaits...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Yes02=We move...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Yes03=<ghostly moan>
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Yes04=As you say...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Yes05=Energy... Need energy!
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARC@Yes06=The Void burns...
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Help00=Battle is upon us!
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed00=By the shadows...
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed01=Twilight falls upon us all.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed02=The shadows writhe around me. 
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed03=I stalk the night.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed04=Raszagal, watch over us!
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed05=I hear an ancient voice whispering from the Void... and it chills my lightless heart.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed_Alt00=By the shadows of Shakuras.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed_Alt01=Twilight falls upon us all.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed_Alt02=The shadows writhe around me. 
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed_Alt03=I stalk the night.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed_Alt04=Raszagal, watch over us!
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed_Alt05=I hear an ancient voice whispering from the Void... and it chills my lightless heart.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes00=I will... comply.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes01=By the Void.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes02=Clever.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes03=Khatum. (Translation: Clever.)
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes04=I am the blade of the Nerazim!
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes05=I am intrigued.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes06=I am but a phantom...
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes_Alt00=I will... comply.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes_Alt01=By the Void.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes_Alt02=Clever.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes_Alt03=Khatum. (Translation: Clever.)
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes_Alt04=I am the blade of Shakuras!
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes_Alt05=I am intrigued.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes_Alt06=I am but a phantom...
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Attack00=Unleash the consuming flame!
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Attack01=A tide of fire and blood.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Attack02=Destruction is at hand.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Attack03=Vok'az Shirol.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Attack04=Unto fate.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Attack05=<excited exertion> Oh, yes!
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Attack06=Gladly.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Attack07=The will of the Tal'darim!
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Help00=Only destruction awaits our foes.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Pissed00=Creation is meaningless, even a mindless organism can create.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Pissed01=Destruction, however... one's will imposed upon the universe, that is true expression.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Pissed02=The flames of Alarak's wrath will purge this universe of Amon's worshippers. And I shall be the instrument of their destruction.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Pissed03=I feel like destroying something beautiful. To be fair, I always feel this way.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Pissed04=This vessel has as much in common with a void ray as a spear does with a twig.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Pissed05=Show me your foes. And I shall destroy them! Burn them to ash! And then, I'll destroy the ash. Muahaha.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Pissed06=The Nerazim have constructed an Annihilator? Perhaps we have more in common than we think.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Pissed07=I yearn to fly through the darkened skies of Slayn. And then DESTROY them.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Ready00=The Death Fleet descends.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Ready_Alt00=Let destruction commence.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@What00=I am the ember of eternity.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@What01=Destruction awaits all traitors.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@What02=Karaz arak shizol.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@What03=Give me purpose.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@What04=Your foes shall burn.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@What05=Speak your command.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@What06=The time has come.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@What07=Betrayal is death.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Yes00=Your will, imposed.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Yes01=Ash and cinder.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Yes02=Understood.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Yes03=Seek and destroy.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Yes04=Not long now.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Yes05=Extermination shall come.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Yes06=Rik'kan virok.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARC@Yes07=Bloodshards aligning.
VoiceOver/DragoonVoid/ARC@Attack00=Commencing.

VoiceOver/Fenix/ARC@Pissed00=On this battlefield I seek only glorious combat. We need not speak, Hierarch, our blades shall speak for us.
VoiceOver/Fenix/ARC@Pissed01=What is it you seek, my friend?
VoiceOver/Fenix/ARC@Pissed02=It is in the forge of combat that I feel closest to Fenix's memories. I can see clearly through his eyes.
VoiceOver/Fenix/ARC@Pissed03=As he tore through his enemies, Fenix would repeat to himself a code he lived by. That reminded him why he fought.
VoiceOver/Fenix/ARC@Pissed04=I fear no enemy. For the khala is my strength.
VoiceOver/Fenix/ARC@Pissed05=I fear not death. For strength is eternal.
VoiceOver/Fenix/ARC@Pissed06=May his deeds be remembered forever, and his death never forgotten.
VoiceOver/Fenix/ARC@Ready00=Show me my enemy!

VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Attack04=For Aiur!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Attack05=We will overcome.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Attack06=Together, we vanquish.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Help00=Our foe strikes!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed00=With the Khala fallen to corruption, the memories of our ancestors are lost to us.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed01=For the first time, the halls of the Templar Archives are silent.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed02=It has been difficult to bear.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed03=Without the Khala to rely on our power has proven difficult to control, but not impossible. 
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed04=Your thoughts are growing harder to read... It seems my strength has not fully returned.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed05=Let me try something... You are feeling... happy. No, sad. No, wait, happy. <frustrated exertion> How do the dark templar deal with this?
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed06=(sigh) I do not even know how I feel any more...
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed07=I am sorry, our situation is difficult... I lack even the will to make lightning puns... Shocking, I know. Oh, I did it!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Pissed09=What's my line again?

VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes01=I heed the call.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes02=As ever, I serve.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes03=I will comply.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes04=O lok-natal. (Translation: I will comply.)
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes05=Unity through purpose.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes06=We continue on.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/ARC@Yes07=For Artanis.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Pissed00=My memory is not what it was....
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Pissed01=These steel limbs are not my own.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Pissed02=I have known only an eternity of war.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Pissed03=My resolve is unending.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Pissed04=There can be only one.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Pissed05=Back in my day I had to teleport to and from school in the snow. Uphill both dimensions.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Pissed06=Youth is wasted on the young.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Pissed07=Where is my walker...? Oh, I'm in it.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Pissed08=The second thing to go is your memory. I can't remember what the first thing is.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Yes00=It is destined.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Yes01=Ik s'abeel. (Translation: It is destined.)
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Yes02=There shall be a reckoning.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Yes03=Por zalah!
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Yes04=Our cannons shall sing.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARC@Yes05=We march to victory!

VoiceOver/Instigator/ARC@Yes06=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Attack00=Strike now!
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Attack01=The opportune moment has come.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Attack02=Together, we cannot be matched.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Attack03=We cannot fail now.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Attack04=Witness the power of a phase-smith!
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Attack05=Templari paru! (Translation: Justice awaits!)
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Attack06=E-sa ahtu! (Translation: Foes beware!)
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Attack07=Foes beware!
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Death00=I die... a Templar.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Help00=I am engaging our foe.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Pissed00=The task ahead of us is difficult, but worthwhile.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Pissed01=I see the grand design behind it all. The intricate machinery of the universe and everything within it.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Pissed02=These psionic storms are growing worse. Destroying this power structure will likely cause a catastrophic failure.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Pissed03=It's a shame the Spear of Adun must engage Amon's zerg brood. Its aid would make our task a great deal simpler.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Pissed04=I hope my drones are doing alright up there...
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Pissed05=It has only been a short while since we returned to Aiur and had to flee from it. Yet it seems like a lifetime ago.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Pissed06=The Khalai long served the firstborn. We were the great builders, the dreamers of dreams and now we are all equal.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Pissed07=I am a phase-smith and I am a Templar... Fenix was right, it is indeed a glorious day.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Ready00=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@What00=Yes, Hierarch? 
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@What01=My expertise is yours.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@What02=What may I resolve? 
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@What03=I will find the solution.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@What04=I hear you.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@What05=We are all Templar.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@What06=Amon shall not prevail.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@What07=Na ku a'fal Aiur. (Translation: We shall avenge Aiur!)
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@What08=A phase-smith is always prepared.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Yes00=It will be.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Yes01=I concur.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Yes02=We are united.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Yes03=The psi-matrix will fall.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Yes04=Progress is made by the bold.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Yes05=Shan-ala-ari Daelaam.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Yes06=Purpose guides us.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARC@Yes07=Aiur will be restored.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Attack00=My power is vast.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Attack01=You will not decide our fate!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Attack02=Be gone.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Attack03=Your time has ended.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Attack04=I am unstoppable.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Attack05=I sense their fear...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Attack06=All shall be one with the light!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Death00=This was not to be...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Help00=I strike at the enemy!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Pissed00=So long as Amon lives, we are all in peril.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Pissed01=I will bring peace to the cosmos.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Pissed02=So many universes came before us, all of them turns in the Infinite Cycle...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Pissed03=I am the culmination of prophecy.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Pissed04=I can see everything now... 
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Pissed05=...the thread of my life interwoven with the threads of many others'.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Pissed06=Alone, we were fragile. But together, we formed a bond that cannot break.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Pissed07=That bond must sustain us now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Ready00=I am infinite.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@What00=What is it you require?
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@What01=Speak to me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@What02=My destiny manifests.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@What03=Infinity unravels before me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@What04=A new age will dawn.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@What05=Amon shall meet his end.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@What06=I can see... countless universes.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Yes00=The final stand begins now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Yes01=I am called.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Yes02=I cannot delay.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Yes03=This is my burden to bear.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Yes04=I will not fail.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARC@Yes05=It shall be.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Attack00=You're in my way...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Attack01=No mercy.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Attack02=Death awaits you!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Attack03=I sense your fear.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Attack04=Slay them all!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Attack05=This is what you deserve.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Attack06=Whatever it takes.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Death00=This isn't over...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Help00=The fight begins.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Pissed00=My true enemy waits in the darkness.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Pissed01=Amon and his hybrid will die.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Pissed02=This is the true war--the one that could end everything.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Pissed03=I hope your gods have an awfully good explanation for why I ended up here with you, Artanis. 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Pissed04=Are you trying to annoy me?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Pissed05=Well, here's a hint for you... It's working.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Pissed06=I quit infesting terrans, but you're starting to make me reconsider that.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Pissed07=I bet Abathur could mutate you into something real special.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Pissed08=So much has happened. Sometimes the past seven years really feel more like seventeen years... 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Ready00=I will not be stopped.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@What00=What is it, already?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@What01=Speak.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@What02=Yes?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@What03=Your queen listens.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@What04=You have my attention.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@What05=Explain yourself.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@What06=Make it quick.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Yes00=I am the Swarm.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Yes01=Boldly.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Yes02=No time like the present.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Yes03=My search continues...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Yes04=I've come this far.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARC@Yes05=I need answers.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Attack00=Initiating purification.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Attack01=They shall be cleansed.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Attack02=Sanitizing.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Attack03=Righteous fury burns brightest.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Attack04=Priming weapon systems.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Attack05=Rono hashik. (Translation: Directive confirmed.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Attack06=Eliminating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Help00=Target in range.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed00=The Purifiers heed your call.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed01=Honor our sacrifice.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed02=We have chosen the path of duty. We ask only for the respect we are owed.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed03=I pledged my life to the Templar... What have you done?
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed04=Ask not what your robotic warrior can do for you, but what you can do for your robotic warrior.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed05=What can you do for me? Well... I would like some weapons upgrades.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed06=And... perhaps some high capacity power fluctuators...
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed07=Hm, that new trillic compression mesh looks very imposing, does it not?
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed08=And would a fresh coat of paint be too much to add? It has been millennia, after all.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Pissed09=It takes a lot of work to look this good after thousands of years.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Ready00=I return to the skies.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@What00=I soar again.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@What01=I answer the call.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@What02=All systems ready.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@What03=Activating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@What04=Too long have I rested.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@What05=My will is my own.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@What06=War has no end.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Yes00=Assigning navigation.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Yes01=Lokh-tai. (Translation: Immediately.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Yes02=Calibrating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Yes03=Order received.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Yes04=O verash. (Translation: I understand.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Yes05=Complying.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARC@Yes06=Taking flight.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Attack00=Ascension through battle!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Attack01=They shall flee before me!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Attack02=For the Tal'darim.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Attack03=They shall die most painfully.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Attack04=My triumph awaits.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Attack05=No one stands against me.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Attack06=Vok'az Shirol!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Help00=Commencing bloodshed.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Pissed00=Weakness is a path to death.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Pissed01=The Templar have words... The Tal'darim have blades!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Pissed02=Before we became the Chosen, we were the Forged. And we can never be broken.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Pissed03=We do not waste time with engineering and manufacture. The weak provide our weapons and our ships.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Pissed04=Piloting a ship is no more complicated than wielding a blade. I know what every panel in this vessel does! Except... this one.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Pissed05=<Button pressing sound effect> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Pissed06=<Beeping sound effect> No! Cease that infernal noise! Do not make me turn this ship around!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Pissed07=<Beeping sound effect continues> Argh! Be silent! <Smashing sound, then all is quiet>
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Pissed08=There. Now for you... I may not be your real mothership, but you still have to obey me!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Ready00=Victory has come.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@What00=You presume to speak?
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@What01=Impress me.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@What02=This had better be worthwhile.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@What03=I will not suffer fools.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@What04=Fealty unto the Highlord.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@What05=We are the soul of strength.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@What06=My will is iron.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Yes00=A fine scheme.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Yes01=We are in agreement... this time.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Yes02=So long as it leads to glory.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Yes03=By our birthright.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Yes04=I shall indulge.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Yes05=A worthy order.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARC@Yes06=Rik'kan thok ishar.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Help00=Engaging the enemy!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Pissed00=I long for the skies of Aiur!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Pissed01=Our fury shall be unleashed.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Pissed02=We shall rise from the ashes!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Pissed03=Valor is my shield!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Pissed04=I used to have a lot of nerve... cords.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Pissed05=Transmute!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Pissed06=Second star on the right, straight on 'til morning.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Pissed07=We push ourselves to the end. And when we reach it, we push farther. (Beat) So I guess that's not really "the end", is it?
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARC@Pissed08=Justice for all!... Except the zerg.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Attack00=My blade thirsts.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Attack01=Death is a gift.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Attack02=They will be purged.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Attack03=The culling begins.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Attack04=Executing.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Attack05=Nothing will remain...
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Death00=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Death01=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Death02=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Help00=I shall relish this battle!
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Pissed00=I stalk the weak.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Pissed01=You have disappointments... I have solutions.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Pissed02=Only warriors deserve the honor of fair combat. I eliminate the rest.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Pissed03=They are always too foolish to sense my presence... until it's too late.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Pissed04=The frail must die so the strong can thrive. Such is the way of Rak'Shir--such is the way of the Tal'darim.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Pissed05=You may find our ways harsh, templar. But it is better to be harsh than pathetic.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Pissed06=Does your Hierarch listen to you? Because I don't.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Ready00=I seek the unworthy.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@What00=Ah, the scent of fear.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@What01=I sense...weakness. Frailty.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@What02=Where does my prey hide?
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@What03=My search goes on.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@What04=I yearn for slaughter.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@What05=Blood will be spilled.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Yes00=If you are certain.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Yes01=As you will it.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Yes02=With pleasure.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Yes03=Yes?
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Yes04=Viras Rakan!
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Yes05=Skosal vin'shir.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Yes06=I hunt.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARC@Yes07=It shall be so.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack00=Let their blood be spilled.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack01=Death has come for you.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack02=This is why I live.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack03=The slaughter begins.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack04=I will enjoy this.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack05=Your reckoning is at hand.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack06=Be afraid.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack07=Nowhere to run.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack_NP00=For the Swarm.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Attack_NP01=I obey.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Death00=I do not... fear death.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Death01=I see... the Void...
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Death02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Death03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Death04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Death_NP00=Service... Complete.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Help00=The enemy seeks my death.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Pissed00=The disgraced are forced to become Vanguards. The truly loyal choose to become Slayers.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Pissed01=Wherever you go... there I am.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Pissed02=Don't blink.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Pissed03=The Nerazim's stalkers are pathetic. They should move on with their lives.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Pissed04=Don't worry if you find me hard to hit. It's just a phase.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Pissed05=Before you see the Void... you must DIE.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Pissed06=In every generation, there are the chosen ones. Together, they will stand against the enemies of the Tal'darim. They are the slayers.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Ready00=Fear the shadows.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Ready_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@What00=Death awaits.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@What01=I am the Highlord's weapon.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@What02=Our enemies shall suffer.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@What03=I have made my choice.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@What04=Set me loose upon our foes.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@What05=The weak will be culled.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@What_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@What_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Yes00=I move unseen.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Yes01=As Alarak commands.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Yes02=Deadly.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Yes03=I pursue.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Yes04=Hunt and kill.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Yes05=None can hide.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Yes06=Of course.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARC@Yes07=I sense their fear.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Attack00=Death comes to all.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Attack01=Dum adu'nala. (Translation: Death comes to all.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Attack02=The Void hungers....
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Attack03=Cold fury.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Attack04=Antu kahl. (Translation: Cold fury.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Attack05=Forever sleep.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Attack06=Complete the cycle.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Attack07=For Shakuras!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Death00=Finally...
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Help00=Let our enemy know our fury!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Help_Alt00=Fall back to the shadows!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed00=My heart is colder than these steel limbs.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed01=Twilight comes as it must.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed02=We are all but shadows in the Void.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed03=I hear the call of the stars.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed04=Night falls. And so will you.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed05=I am one with the darkness... (Crashing sound) Ouch! That hurt.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed06=You look better in the dark.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed07=Don't blink.... Or you''ll miss me.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed08=Now you see me... now you don't. Oh, wait... here I am. 
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed09=You went to bed early last night.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed10=I see you turned off your phone.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed11=You never return my calls.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed12=I'm your biggest fan.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed13=Restraining order? What about our love?
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Pissed14=I have pictures of you. Hundreds.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@What00=Cold is the Void.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@What01=I am the heart of darkness.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@What02=You require my skills?
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@What03=I am the voice of the eclipse.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@What04=State thy bidding. 
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@What05=We are one with the shadows.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Yes00=Very well.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Yes01=It shall be as you say.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Yes02=Intriguing.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Yes03=Veraku. (Translation: Intriguing.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Yes04=I serve... for now.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Yes05=We move unseen.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Yes06=For the reckoning.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARC@Yes07=Very wise. 
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Attack00=I protect.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Attack01=Guarding.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Attack02=Sacred land...
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Attack03=Aiur's foes burn.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Attack04=For the Firstborn.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Attack05=None withstand...
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Attack06=As one!
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Help00=Embracing battle!
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Pissed00=I am called.

VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Pissed04=Never rest.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Pissed05=Blades ready.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Pissed06=Unending duty...

VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@What02=Command me.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@What03=Seek justice.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@What04=I serve.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@What05=For unity.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@What06=I am summoned.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Yes00=With honor.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Yes01=En taro Tassadar. (Translation: In honor of Tassadar.)
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Yes02=Your will.

VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Yes04=Khassar. (Translation: Order.)
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Yes05=It shall be.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARC@Yes06=Kios. (Translation: Affirmative.)
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Attack00=You wish for devastation?
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Attack01=This battle is ours.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Attack02=Annihilating.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Attack03=With full force.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Attack04=All shall be pure.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Attack05=Terminating.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Attack06=Na vazil. (Translation: We terminate.)
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Help00=Locking on target.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Pissed00=There is still valor to be won among the stars.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Pissed01=The Purifiers will retake their rightful place among the Templar.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Pissed02=Your Hierarch is unlike the Judicators we have known. He is a bright spark in a series of shadows.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Pissed03=We protoss have many ways of surviving the brutalities of battle. But only the way of the Purifiers ensures eternal life.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Pissed04=I do wish I had considered the Conclave's preconceived notions about robotic intelligence before joining the Purifier program.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Pissed05=Communication matrices nearing maximum capacity. Recalibrating memory web.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Pissed06=Error 0b100101, response not found.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Pissed07=I am the true hero of the storm.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Ready00=You seek our aid?
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@What00=We hold the power of the past.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@What01=Valor is eternal.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@What02=What is our charge?
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@What03=We overcome.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@What04=Salokim ku ara ki! (Translation: The Purifiers shall rise again.)
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@What05=There is no greater glory than battle.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@What06=We seek honor through duty.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Yes00=We accept.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Yes01=As it was in the days of old.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Yes02=We stand with the Firstborn.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Yes03=Consider it done.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Yes04=We serve by our own will.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Yes05=Ul'uhn addari. (Translation: By our will.)
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARC@Yes06=For honor!
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Attack00=Conflict is my penance.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Attack01=Absolution.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Attack02=Purging fire!
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Attack03=Viras Rakan!
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Attack04=My fate is bound.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Attack05=I am unleashed.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Attack06=Our foes shall be scattered.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Death00=My transgressions... forgotten.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Death01=I am but memory.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Help00=The fires of conflict burn bright.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Pissed00=Even broken links can be made to serve the chain of ascension.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Pissed01=I am the last link in the chain of ascension. I am a Vanguard, and only my death shall have meaning.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Pissed02=Forgiveness is a Templar virtue. I seek only for my failures to be forgotten.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Pissed03=We are the first to battle, and if fate smiles upon us, we shall never return.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Pissed04=You Templar refer to your assault striders as "Immortals". Our cultures are quite different, indeed.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Pissed05=To think of the trouble the Tal'darim have caused the Templar. Be thankful you never encountered the Venti'darim.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Pissed06=I tire, and my thoughts darken. Leave me to them.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Ready00=The hour is upon us.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@What00=We are reforged.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@What01=I will serve.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@What02=Unto death.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@What03=Ever atoning.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@What04=Sko'rishar vinok.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@What05=Grant me my end.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@What06=Order me to war.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@What07=I am the first line.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Yes00=Willingly.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Yes01=So shall I suffer.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Yes02=As fate decrees.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Yes03=For the Highlord.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Yes04=As the chain commands.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Yes05=I obey.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Yes06=Unquestioned.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARC@Yes07=We advance.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARC@Help00=We face the enemy!
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARC@Pissed00=All paths are seen through the prism of fate.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARC@Pissed01=United in purpose, we serve the Daelaam.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARC@Pissed02=Conflict must not be seen through the lens of desperation.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARC@Pissed03=Infinity burns around us.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARC@Pissed04=There is no greater void than the one between your ears.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARC@Pissed05=I am also null.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARC@Pissed06=Always bet on void.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Attack00=The path to victory awaits!
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Attack01=For our homeland!
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Attack02=Zhakan s'ak-ash! (Translation: The shadows are my shield!)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Attack03=The shadows are my shield!
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Attack04=Twilight enshrouds me.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Attack05=This shall be our day of triumph.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Attack06=Zhakul gulida! (Translation: Darkness awaits!)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Death00=Our legacy lives on...
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Help00=I strike at our foe!
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Pissed00=Together, we shall ensure the future of our people.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Pissed01=Our blades burn brightest in dark times.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Pissed02=This is the greatest battle we could ever hope to win.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Pissed03=I am Matriarch of the Nerazim. We have sheltered our brethren from Aiur, yet our differences persist.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Pissed04=I do not wish to speak ill of the Templar... But let us be honest. Most of you could not complete the Shadow Walk.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Pissed05=Not that we wouldn't enjoy watching you try.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Pissed06=But... that is a matter for times of peace. For now, we are at war.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Ready00=The Nerazim will answer.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@What00=Yes?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@What01=What is your will?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@What02=I walk the shadowed path.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@What03=Nas beru s'adarr? (Translation: You seek my service?)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@What04=We must form a plan.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@What05=You require counsel?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@What06=There is little time.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Yes00=En aru'din Shakuras. (Translation: In memory of Shakuras.)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Yes01=We stand with our allies.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Yes02=Our future is the Daelaam.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Yes03=Neraz gulio. (Translation: Truth before authority.)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Yes04=It is my honor.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARC@Yes05=There is much to be done.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Attack00=Blades of justice!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Attack01=It must be done.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Attack02=None shall stand!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Attack03=Aruu nal adan!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Attack04=We strike as one!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Attack05=Our fury is boundless.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Attack06=None can withstand the Templar!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Death00=For Aiur...
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Help00=We embrace the glory of battle!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Pissed00=I am Templar. I am the sword of truth.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Pissed01=Combat is the anvil of will.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Pissed02=Our enemies must be eradicated.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Pissed03=Victory is the only truth that matters.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Pissed04=Fear is for the enemy. 
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Pissed05=Do not make me count to zmidlarj.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Pissed06=It is said that ignorance is bliss. Tell me, is that true?
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Pissed07=How peaceful it must be for you, to have a mind unburdened by thought.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Ready00=My life for Aiur!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@What00=My meditation is over.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@What01=Orin shi s'al.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@What02=Command me.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@What03=Justice be done!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@What04=We are the blades of Aiur!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@What05=We stand unified.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@What06=Na adan daelaam.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Yes00=Honor guides me.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Yes01=En taro Tassadar!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Yes02=By your will.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Yes03=Ul'as addari.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Yes04=Khassar de templari!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARC@Yes05=For Artanis!
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Attack00=Vengeance is at hand.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Attack01=Blood for blood.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Attack02=My death awaits.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Attack03=Ascension for the fallen.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Attack04=Remember me.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Attack05=I will not die alone.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Attack06=My purpose is fulfilled.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Attack_NP00=For the Swarm.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Attack_NP01=I obey.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Death00=Victory through death.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Death01=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Death02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Death03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Death04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Death_NP00=Service... Complete.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Help00=We strike at the Highlord's foes.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Pissed00=I will be of use, dead or alive.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Pissed01=If Alarak wishes my death, he need only ask.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Pissed02=It is a thankless job, but someone has to do it.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Pissed03=All supplicants must die. All supplicants must serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Pissed04=Ah, the Breath of Creation. More like the Breath of Recreation, am I right?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Pissed05=There was once a Supplicant who stood head and shoulders above the rest of us. He was a Tall-darim.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Pissed06=Okay, maybe I deserve to die for that one.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Pissed07=A few of the other supplicants and I have a bet going over which of us dies first. We call it... the "dead league." We're still working on the name.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Pissed08=Witness me!
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Ready00=My life for the Highlord.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Ready_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@What00=I will adhere to the chain.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@What01=Awaiting your decree.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@What02=Eternal obedience.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@What03=My sacrifice will have meaning.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@What04=Loyalty unto death.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@What05=I am a servant of Slayn.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@What06=Oblivion beckons.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@What_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@What_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Yes00=As you will it.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Yes01=I live to serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Yes02=My fate is in your hands.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Yes03=For Alarak.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Yes04=I hear and obey.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Yes05=Without remorse.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Attack00=The shadow descends.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Attack01=Break before us!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Attack02=Your end has come.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Attack03=Zerashk gulida!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Attack04=Face the endless Void!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Attack05=May our blades strike true.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Attack06=As fate decrees.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Death00=Void embrace me.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Death01=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Death02=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Death03=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Death04=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Help00=Our blades meet the enemy.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed00=I am Shadow Guard. I am the shield of twilight.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed01=Our duty is bound to the Matriarch's will.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed02=We are the nameless guardians of the Nerazim.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed03=Each legion of Shadow Guard consists of exactly one hundred Centurions. Never more, never less. Unless one falls in battle, and then we replace them... quickly.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed04=What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? I shall tell you once I meet an unstoppable force.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed05=Not all Nerazim can merge themselves with the shadows. Some of us merely bend it to our will, from time to time.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed06=We fashion armor from the bones of our prey. It is a grand tradition reminding us of how far we have come... No. We do not have "jaw envy."
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed07=The Templar zealots won't admit it, but our shadow charge is stunning.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Ready00=I walk the shadowed path.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@What00=The Shadow Guard waits.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@What01=Give us your command.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@What02=We stand watch.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@What03=Na adan sai'osh.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@What04=Ever vigilant.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@What05=We await our charge.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@What06=None shall break us.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Yes00=So be it.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Yes01=Your command is law.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Yes02=For Vorazun!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Yes03=The guard moves.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Yes04=We shall shield this world.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Yes05=Eternally resolute.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Attack00=Executing.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Attack01=As the Hierarch wills.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Attack02=Know the might of the Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Attack03=We are the overwhelming tide.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Attack04=Your purification is at hand!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Attack05=To glorious battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Attack06=Be undone!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Death00=Releasing consciousness.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Help00=We meet the enemy in battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed00=I am a Sentinel. I am undying. I am pure.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed01=Glacius may have fallen, but we, its children, live on.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed02=We are the first. The Purifiers, reborn.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed03=It is treatment like this that caused the first generation of Purifiers to rebel against their creators. Do you really wish to test me?
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed04=Test complete. All systems are working perfectly.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed05=Calling me a robotic zealot demeans both me and my people. We prefer mechanical Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed06=When I get knocked down, I get up again. No one will ever keep me down.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed07=A purifier's purity ring represents their commitment to stay pure and to burn anything to death that would attempt to compromise that commitment.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Ready00=This warrior awakens.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@What00=Listening.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@What01=Guide my blade.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@What02=The enemy shall be purified.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@What03=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@What04=Speak your demands.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@What05=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@What06=Identify our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Yes00=Ul'as addari.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Yes01=Protocols aligned.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Yes02=With honor.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Yes03=My blade yearns to meet our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Yes04=For Fenix!
