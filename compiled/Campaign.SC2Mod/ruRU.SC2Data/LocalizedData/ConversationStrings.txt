Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00014=Think I'll get back to running this show.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00015=Alright, I'm taking back control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00016=Can't hurt to take a look.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00017=We've scoped out this area. Scout's heading back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00018=Once I've trained up some soldiers we'll head out.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00019=Can't reach that location, partner.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00020=Little busy here. I'll send something out in a minute.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00021=Dammit, they killed my SCV. I'm sending out another.

Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00023=Taking this raven back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00024=Building a raven now.

Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00026=We're going to take that expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00027=Putting up a command center.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00028=Can't reach that.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00029=Looks like we're facing some protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00030=Well, looks like our enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00031=We've got zerg over here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00032=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00033=Well, there's some familiar terran designs.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00034=Looks like a zerg building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00035=Looks like we've found a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00036=Bad guys, straight ahead.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00037=What the hell is this building doing all the way out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00038=We march forth.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00039=Understood. Our warriors move.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00040=We require more warriors. We shall attack once ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00041=None shall pass.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00042=We will defend once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00043=We move for victory!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00044=Мы должны отступить!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00045=The attack will commence once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00046=I am in command.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00047=The enemy has cloaked! We require detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00048=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00049=Our scouts are headed to this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00050=Our scouting party returns.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00051=Our scouts will head to this location as soon as they can.

Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00054=An observer is on its way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00055=Our detector must return to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00056=We are warping in a detector, immediately.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00057=Our detector has been slain! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00058=This location is ideal for our expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00059=Expansion secured. We are warping in a Nexus now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00060=Our forces cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00061=Our enemy is Protoss.

Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00064=We have encountered an enemy Protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00065=This building belongs to the terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00066=This building bears the tainted flesh of the zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00067=The enemy's base has been discovered.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00068=We have encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00069=Не оставляйте следов!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00070=I'm not ready. We'll attack once I've morphed enough zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00071=We'll have a surprise in store for them.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00072=My army isn't large enough. I'll defend as soon as I'm able.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00073=We are probing the enemy for weakness.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00074=The Swarm is returning to base. We're taking too many losses.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00075=Now we do things my way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00076=The enemy can cloak!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00077=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00078=Значит, протоссы хотят повоевать.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00079=The enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00080=An enemy brood wishes to challenge us?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00081=I agree. We will begin the attack once my army is ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00082=We've encountered a protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00083=There's an enemy zerg hive cluster around here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00084=We've discovered the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00085=We've encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00086=Why would they build this structure out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00087=Our scout is on the move.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00088=We've scouted the area. I'm taking my scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00089=My scout cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00090=Give me a moment. I'll scout as soon as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00091=They killed my scout! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00092=I require detection for other purposes.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00093=It's time to find out what's really going on.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00094=I'm morphing as quickly as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00095=They've killed the detector! I'm sending another.

Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00099=A terran building...
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00100=Plant it, raiders.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00101=My boys are training right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00102=You can count on us.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00103=Heading out, and playing it cool.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00104=Encountering some tough resistance.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00105=My guys are headed back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00106=We're heading back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00107=I'm ordering an attack here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00108=Let's ruffle their feathers a bit!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00109=It's a little too crazy out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00110=Alright Raiders, back under my command.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00111=Time to get back to business.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00112=Done scouting.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00113=All done here. I'll take that scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00114=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00115=Scout's on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00116=My scout can't get there.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00117=You got a teleporter? Otherwise, we ain't getting there.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00118=Ни за что.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00119=Looks like my scout's wrapping things up.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00120=Yeah, that's not happenin' right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00121=Great... Scout's dead.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00122=They got my scout!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00123=Get that command center built.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00124=Not gonna be able to pull that one off.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00125=Alright, I'm taking an expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00126=Build a raven, boys. Pronto.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00127=They busted my raven!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00128=Raven heading out.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00129=I'm gonna have to say no for now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00130=Their base is over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00131=Kinda far out for a building, don't ya think?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00132=And that would be the base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00133=Well, what do we have here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00134=Ran into an enemy base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00135=Looks like the bad guys have set up shop here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00136=That's one way to find the enemy.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00137=Looks like the enemy's shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00138=That's a zerg structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00139=Terran building sighted, and it ain't one of mine.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00140=We've found a protoss structure over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00141=Well, there's definitely enemy protoss out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00142=There's some hostile terrans out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00143=Aw man, zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00144=The protoss are looking for a fight.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00145=Terrans... Kill them.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00146=Этим зергам нужно напомнить, кто их королева.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00147=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00148=This building is terran in origin.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00149=This structure belongs to an enemy brood.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00150=The enemy's base is here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00151=Our enemy is headquartered here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00152=There. Our foe's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00153=Here. We've found the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00154=Strange. This structure doesn't belong here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00155=This base belongs to our foes.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00156=The enemy's forces have presented themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00157=The enemy. Good, I was getting bored.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00158=The Swarm is assaulting here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00159=The Swarm spares no one!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00160=My forces are not ready yet.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00161=Мы избавимся от них.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00162=The enemy will regret coming here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00163=Curious, this building is far from a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00164=My forces need time to prepare.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00165=My brood is engaging here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00166=Slay them all! No quarter!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00167=We must return to the hive cluster.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00168=We're pulling back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00169=I am morphing more zerg. We will attack when ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00170=Extending control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00171=The Swarm is mine once again.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00172=We need detection.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00173=We are being overwhelmed!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00174=Where are the reinforcements?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00175=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00176=We concur. Our forces are en route.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00178=Our warriors are being readied.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00179=Here, we make our stand.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00180=We require additional warriors.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00181=Our forces will assault this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00182=We cannot survive this battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00183=Our warriors must pull back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARC@Line00184=This fight is lost. We retreat.

VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Pissed01=Мы пришли сюда не как завоеватели, но как избавители, чтобы вернуть свободу этому народу. /// We come not as conquerors, but as liberators to return freedom to the people.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Pissed02=<SFX: Missile firing> Вот вам свобода.

VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Pissed03=Если тебе нужно освободить от противника какую-то область, «Освободитель» к твоим услугам. Только за ее границами каждый сам по себе. /// If there's a piece of ground you want secure, my Liberator can handle it. Anywhere around it? You're kind of on you own.

Красота ведь! /// We've learned a lot about transforming vehicles since the Viking. Hell, I've only had one crewman snap his spine this week.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Pissed05=Никому не говори, но я однажды управляла «Угнетателем»... Это было еще в школе, так что не считается.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Pissed06=Я — за полную свободу выбора. Например, каждый может согласиться выполнить отданный ему приказ или не согласиться и умереть в муках. /// I'm a strong believer in personal liberty.

VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Pissed07=Ух ты, из «Освободителя» в диктатора за 5 секунд. Да это просто рекорд! /// Wow, Liberator to dictator in 5 seconds. That's gotta be some kind of record!
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/ARC@Pissed08=За свободу, кстати, платят кровью. Это каждый дурак знает. /// By the way, freedom is NOT free, okay? Freedom costs a buck o' five! Everyone knows that!

Character/Description/ARC@ZealotAlarak=Supplicants are the lowest ranking Tal'darim. They live to serve and die for those above them on the Chain of Ascension, at least until they gain enough power and influence to challenge them to Rak'Shir.

VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Yes04=Слушаю и повинуюсь. /// I hear and obey.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARC@Yes05=Без сожаления. /// Without remorse.

VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed00=Я темный страж. Я щит сумерек. /// I am Shadow Guard. I am the shield of twilight.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed01=Наш долг – исполнять волю матриарха. /// Our duty is bound to the Matriarch's will.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARC@Pissed02=Мы – безымянные стражи неразимов. /// We are the nameless guardians of the Nerazim.

VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed03=Из-за подобного обращения первое поколение чистильщиков восстало против своих создателей. Ты точно хочешь испытать мое терпение? /// It is treatment like this that caused the first generation of Purifiers to rebel against their creators. Do you really wish to test me?
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed04=Проверка завершена. Все системы в норме. /// Test complete. All systems are working perfectly.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed05=Не называй меня роботом-зилотом. Так ты оскорбляешь мой народ. Мы предпочитаем зваться механическими тамплиерами. /// Calling me a robotic zealot demeans both me and my people. We prefer mechanical Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed06=Если меня собьют с ног, я встану. Никому не дано возобладать надо мной. /// When I get knocked down, I get up again. No one will ever keep me down.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARC@Pissed07=Это кольцо символизирует наше стремление сохранять чистоту и уничтожить все, что может помешать этому стремлению. /// A purifier's purity ring represents their commitment to stay pure and to burn anything to death that would attempt to compromise that commitment.
